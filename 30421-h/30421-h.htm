<p>The <i>Age of Pope</i> is designed to form one of a series of
Handbooks, edited by Professor Hales, which it is hoped
will be of service to students who love literature for its
own sake, instead of regarding it merely as a branch of
knowledge required by examiners. The period covered by
this volume, which has had the great advantage of Professor
Hales's personal care and revision, may be described
roughly as lying between 1700, the year in which Dryden
died, and 1744, the date of Pope's death.</p>

<p>I believe that no work of the class will be of real value
which gives what may be called literary statistics, and has
nothing more to offer. Historical facts and figures have
their uses, and are, indeed, indispensable; but it is possible
to gain the most accurate knowledge of a literary period
and to be totally unimpressed by the influences which a
love of literature inspires. The first object of a guide is
to give accurate information; his second and larger object
is to direct the reader's steps through a country exhaustless
in variety and interest. If once a passion be awakened for
the study of our noble literature the student will learn to
reject what is meretricious, and will turn instinctively to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
what is worthiest. In the pursuit he may leave his guide
far behind him; but none the less will he be grateful to
the pioneer who started him on his travels.</p>

<p>If the <i>Age of Pope</i> proves of help in this way the wishes
of the writer will be satisfied. It has been my endeavour
in all cases to acknowledge the debt I owe to the authors
who have made this period their study; but it is possible
that a familiar acquaintance with their writings may have
led me occasionally to mistake the matter thus assimilated
for original criticism. If, therefore&mdash;to quote the phrase
of Pope's enemy and my namesake&mdash;I have sometimes
borrowed another man's 'thunder,' the fault of having
'made a sinner of my memory' may prove the reader's
gain, and will, I hope, be forgiven.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The death of John Dryden, on the first of May, 1700,
closed a period of no small significance in the history of
English literature. His faults were many, both as a man
and as a poet, but he belongs to the race of the giants,
and the impress of greatness is stamped upon his works.
No student of Dryden can fail to mark the force and sweep
of an intellect impatient of restraint. His 'long-resounding
march' reminds us of a turbulent river that overflows its
banks, and if order and perfection of art are sometimes
wanting in his verse, there is never the lack of power.
Unfortunately many of the best years of his life were
devoted to a craft in which he was working against the
grain. His dramas, with one or two noble exceptions, are
comparative failures, and in them he too often</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza12">
<span class="i0">'Profaned the God-given strength, and marred the lofty line.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In two prominent respects his influence on his successors
is of no slight significance. As a satirist Pope acknowledged
the master he was unable to excel, and so did
many of the eighteenth century versemen, who appear to
have looked upon satire as the beginning and the end of
poetry. Moreover Dryden may be regarded, without much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
exaggeration, as the father of modern prose. Nothing can
be more lucid than his style, which is at once bright and
strong, idiomatic and direct. He knows precisely what he
has to say, and says it in the simplest words. It is the
form and not the substance of Dryden's prose to which
attention is drawn here. There is a splendour of imagery,
a largeness of thought, and a grasp of language in the
prose of Hooker, of Jeremy Taylor, and of Milton which is
beyond the reach of Dryden, but he has the merit of using
a simple form of English free from prolonged periods and
classical constructions, and fitted therefore for common
use. The wealthy baggage of the prose Elizabethans and
their immediate successors was too cumbersome for ordinary
travel; Dryden's riches are less massive, but they can
be easily carried, and are always ready for service.</p>

<p>In these respects he is the literary herald of a century
which, in the earlier half at least, is remarkable in the use
it makes of our mother tongue for the exercise of common
sense. The Revolution of 1688 produced a change in
English politics scarcely more remarkable than the change
that took place a little later in English literature and is to
be seen in the poets and wits who are known familiarly
as the Queen Anne men. It will be obvious to the most
superficial student that the gulf which separates the literary
period, closing with the death of Milton in 1674, from
the first half of the eighteenth century, is infinitely wider
than that which divides us from the splendid band of poets
and prose writers who made the first twenty years of the
present century so famous. There is, for example, scarcely
more than fifty years between the publication of Herrick's
<i>Hesperides</i> and of Addison's <i>Campaign</i>, between the <i>Holy
Living</i> of Taylor and the <i>Tatler</i> of Steele, and less
than fifty years between <i>Samson Agonistes</i>, which Bishop
Atterbury asked Pope to polish, and the poems of Prior.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Yet in that short space not only is the form of verse
changed but also the spirit.</p>

<p>Speaking broadly, and allowing for exceptions, the
literary merits of the Queen Anne time are due to invention,
fancy, and wit, to a genius for satire exhibited in verse
and prose, to a regard for correctness of form and to the sensitive
avoidance of extremes. The poets of the period are
for the most part without enthusiasm, without passion, and
without the 'fine madness' which, as Drayton says, should
possess a poet's brain. Wit takes precedence of imagination,
nature is concealed by artifice, and the delight afforded
by these writers is not due to imaginative sensibility. Not
even in the consummate genius of Pope is there aught of
the magical charm which fascinates us in a Wordsworth
and a Keats, in a Coleridge and a Shelley. The prose
of the age, masterly though it be, stands also on a comparatively
low level. There is much in it to attract, but
little to inspire.</p>

<p>The difference between the Elizabethan and Jacobean
authors, and the authors of the Queen Anne period cannot
be accounted for by any single cause. The student will
observe that while the inspiration is less, the technical skill
is greater. There are passages in Addison which no seventeenth
century author could have written; there are couplets
in Pope beyond the reach of Cowley, and that even Dryden
could not rival. In these respects the eighteenth century
was indebted to the growing influence of French literature,
to which the taste of Charles II. had in some degree contributed.
One notable expression of this taste may be seen
in the tragedies in rhyme that were for a time in vogue, of
which the plots were borrowed from French romances.
These colossal fictions, stupendous in length and heroic in
style, delighted the young English ladies of the seventeenth
century, and were not out of favour in the eighteenth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
for Pope gave a copy of the <i>Grand Cyrus</i> to Martha
Blount.</p>

<p>The return, as in Addison's <i>Cato</i>, to the classical
unities, so faithfully preserved in the French drama, was
another indication of an influence from which our literature
has never been wholly free. That importations so alien to
the spirit of English poetry should tend to the degeneration
of the national drama was inevitable. For a time, however,
the study of French models, both in the drama and in other
departments of literature, may have been productive of
benefit. Frenchmen knew before we did, how to say what
they wanted to say in a lucid style. Dryden, who was
open to every kind of influence, bad as well as good, caught
a little of their fine tact and consummate workmanship
without lessening his own originality; so also did Pope,
who, if he was considerably indebted to Boileau, infinitely
excelled him. That, in M. Taine's judgment, would have
been no great difficulty. 'In Boileau,' he writes, 'there
are, as a rule, two kinds of verse, as was said by a man of
wit (M. Guillaume Guizot); most of which seem to be those
of a sharp school-boy in the third class; the rest those of a
good school-boy in the upper division.' And Mr. Swinburne,
who holds a similar opinion of the famous French
critic's merit, observes, that while Pope is the finest,
Boileau is 'the dullest craftsman of their age and
school.'<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>With the author of the <i>Lutrin</i> Addison, unlike Pope, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
personally acquainted. Boileau praised his Latin verses,
and although his range was limited, like that of all critics
lacking imagination, Addison, then a comparatively youthful
scholar, was no doubt flattered by his compliments and
learnt some lessons in his school. Prior, who acquired a
mastery of the language, was also sensitive to French
influence, and shows how it affected him by irony and
satire. It would be difficult to estimate with any measure
of accuracy the effect of French literature on the Queen Anne
authors. There is no question that they were considerably
attracted by it, but its sway was, I think, never strong enough
to produce mere imitative art. While the most illustrious
of these men acknowledged some measure of fealty to our
'sweet enemy France,' they were not enslaved by her, and
French literature was but one of several influences which
affected the literary character of the age. If Englishmen
owed a debt to France the obligation was reciprocal.
Voltaire affords a prominent illustration of the power
wielded by our literature. He imitated Addison, he imitated,
or caught suggestions from Swift, he borrowed
largely from Vanbrugh, and although, in his judgment of
English authors, he made many critical blunders, they
were due to a want of taste rather than to a want of
knowledge.</p>

<p>A striking contrast will be seen between the position of
literary men in the reign of Queen Anne and under her
Hanoverian successors. Literature was not thriving in
the healthiest of ways in the earlier period, but from the
commercial point of view it was singularly prosperous.
Through its means men like Addison and Prior rose to some
of the highest offices in the service of their country. Tickell
became Under-Secretary of State. Steele held three or four
official posts, and if he did not prosper like some men of less
mark, had no one but himself to blame. Rowe, the author<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
of the <i>Fair Penitent</i>, was for three years of Anne's reign
Under-Secretary, and John Hughes, the friend of Addison,
who is poet enough to have had his story told by Johnson,
had 'a situation of great profit' as Secretary to the Commissions
of the Peace. Prizes of greater or less value fell
to some men whose abilities were not more than respectable,
but under Walpole and the monarch whom he served literature
was disregarded, and the Minister was content to
make use of hireling writers for whatever dirty work he
required; spending in this way, it is said, £50,000 in ten
years.</p>

<p>It was far better in the long run for men of letters to be
free from the servility of patronage, but there was a wearisome
time, as Johnson and Goldsmith knew to their cost,
during which authors lost their freedom in another way,
and became the slaves of the booksellers. It is pleasant to
observe that the last noteworthy act of patronage in the
century was one that did honour to the patron without
lessening the dignity and independence of the recipient.
Literature owes much to the noblest of political philosophers
for discovering and fostering the genius of one of
the most original of English poets, and every reader of
Crabbe will do honour to the generous friendship of
Edmund Burke.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The lowest stage in our national history was reached
in the Restoration period. The idealists, who had aimed at
marks it was not given to man to reach, were superseded by
men with no ideal, whether in politics or religion. The extreme
rigidity in morals enjoined by State authority in
Cromwell's days, when theological pedantry discovered sin
in what had hitherto been regarded as innocent, led, among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the unsaintly mass of the people, to a hypocrisy even more
corrupting than open vice, and the advent of the most
publicly dissolute of English kings opened the floodgates
of iniquity. The unbridled vice of the time is displayed
in the Restoration dramatists, in the Grammont
memoirs, in the diary of Pepys, and also in that of the
admirable John Evelyn, 'faithful among the faithless.'
Charles II. was considered good-natured because his
manners, unlike those of his father, were sociable, and unrestrained
by Court etiquette. Londoners liked a monarch
who fed ducks in St. James's Park before breakfast; but
an easy temper did not prevent the king from sanctioning
the most unjust and cruel laws, and it allowed him to sell
Dunkirk and basely to accept a pension from France. The
corruption of the age pervaded politics as well as society,
and the self-sacrificing spirit which is the salt of a nation's
life seemed for the time extinct among public men.</p>

<p>When Dutch men-of-war appeared at the Nore the confusion
was great, but there were few resources and few
signs of energy in the men to whom the people looked for
guidance. A man conversant with affairs expressed to
Pepys his opinion that nothing could be done with 'a lazy
Prince, no Council, no money, no reputation at home or
abroad,' and Pepys also gives the damning statement which
is in harmony with all we know of the king, that he 'took
ten times more care and pains in making friends between
my Lady Castlemaine and Mrs. Stewart, when they have
fallen out, than ever he did to save his kingdom.'</p>

<p>There was nothing in the brief reign of James, a reign
for ever made infamous by the atrocious cruelty of
Jeffreys, that calls for comment here, but the Revolution,
despite the undoubted advantages it brought with it, among
which must be mentioned the abolition of the censorship of
the press, brought also an element of discord and of poli<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>tical
degradation. The change was a good one for the
country, but it caused a large number of influential men to
renounce on oath opinions which they secretly held, and it
led, as every reader of history knows, to an unparalleled
amount of double-dealing on the part of statesmen, which
began with the accession of William and Mary and did not
end until the last hopes of the Jacobites were defeated in
1746. The loss of principle among statesmen, and the
bitterness of faction, which seemed to increase in proportion
as the patriotic spirit declined, had a baleful influence on
the latter days of the seventeenth century and on the entire
period covered by the age of Pope. The low tone of the
age is to be seen in the almost universal corruption which
prevailed, in the scandalous tergiversation of Bolingbroke,
and in the contempt for political principle openly avowed
by Walpole, who, as Mr. Lecky observes, 'was altogether
incapable of appreciating as an element of political calculation
the force which moral sentiments exercise upon
mankind.'<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The enthusiasm and strong passions of the first half of
the seventeenth century, which had been crushed by the
Restoration, were exchanged for a state of apathy that led
to self-seeking in politics and to scepticism in religion.
There was a strong profession of morality in words, but in
conduct the most open immorality prevailed. Virtue was
commended in the bulk of the churches, while Christianity,
which gives a new life and aim to virtue, was practically
ignored, and the principles of the Deists, whose opinions
occupied much attention at the time, were scarcely more
alien to the Christian revelation than the views often advocated
in the national pulpits. The religion of Christ
seems to have been regarded as little more than a useful
kind of cement which held society together. The good sense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
advocated so constantly by Pope in poetry was also considered
the principal requisite in the pulpit, and the careful
avoidance of religious emotion in the earlier years of
the century led to the fervid and too often ill-regulated
enthusiasm that prevailed in the days of Whitefield and
Wesley. At the same time there appears to have been no
lack of religious controversy. 'The Church in danger' was
a strong cry then, as it is still. The enormous excitement
caused in 1709 by Sacheverell's sermon in St. Paul's
Cathedral advocating passive obedience, denouncing toleration,
and aspersing the Revolution settlement, forms a
striking chapter in the reign of Queen Anne. Extraordinary
interest was also felt in the Bangorian controversy raised
by Bishop Hoadly, who, in a sermon preached before the
king (1717), took a latitudinarian view of episcopal authority,
and objected to the entire system of the High Church
party.</p>

<p>Queen Caroline, whose keen intellect was allied to a
coarseness which makes her a representative of the age,
was considerably attracted by theological discussion. She
obtained a bishopric for Berkeley, recommended Walpole to
read Butler's <i>Analogy</i>, which was at one time her daily companion
at the breakfast-table, and made the preferment of
its author one of her last requests to the king. She liked
well to reason with Dr. Samuel Clarke, 'of Providence,
Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate,' and wished to make him
Archbishop of Canterbury, but was told that he was not
sufficiently orthodox. Theology was not disregarded under
the first and second Georges; it was only religion that had
fallen into disrepute. The law itself was calculated to excite
contempt for the most solemn of religious services. 'I was
early,' Swift writes to Stella, 'with the Secretary (Bolingbroke),
but he was gone to his devotions and to receive the
sacrament. Several rakes did the same. It was not for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
piety, but for employment, according to Act of Parliament.'</p>

<p>A glance at some additional features in the social condition
of the age will enable us to understand better the
character of its literature.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>It is a platitude to say that authors are as much
affected as other men by the atmosphere which they
breathe. Now and then a consummate man of genius
seems to stand so much above his age as for all high
purposes of art to be untouched by it. Like Milton as a
poet, though not as a prose writer, his 'soul is like a star
and dwells apart;' but in general, imaginative writers,
are intensely affected by the society from which they draw
many of their intellectual resources. In the so-called
'Augustan age'<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> this influence would have been felt more
strongly than in ours, since the range of men of letters was
generally restricted to what was called the Town. They
wrote for the critics in the coffee-houses, for the noblemen
from whom they expected patronage, and for the political
party they were pledged to support.</p>

<p>England during the first half of the eighteenth century
was in many respects uncivilized. London was at that
time separated from the country by roads that were often
impassable and always dangerous. Travellers had to protect
themselves as they best could from the attacks of
highwaymen, who infested every thoroughfare leading from
the metropolis, while the narrow area of the city was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
guarded by watchmen scarcely better fitted for its protection
than Dogberry and Verges. Readers of the <i>Spectator</i>
will remember how when Sir Roger de Coverley went to
the play, his servants 'provided themselves with good
oaken plants' to protect their master from the Mohocks, a
set of dissolute young men, who, for sheer amusement,
inflicted the most terrible punishments on their victims.
Swift tells Stella how he came home early from his walk
in the Park to avoid 'a race of rakes that play the devil
about this town every night, and slit people's noses,' and
he adds, as if party were at the root of every mischief in the
country, that they were all Whigs. 'Who has not trembled
at the Mohock's name?' is Gay's exclamation in his <i>Trivia</i>;
and in that curious poem he also warns the citizens not to
venture across Lincoln's Inn Fields in the evening. Colley
Cibber's brazen-faced daughter, Mrs. Charke, in the <i>Narrative</i>
of her life, describes also with sufficient precision the
dangers of London after dark.</p>

<p>The infliction of personal injury was not confined to the
desperadoes of the streets. Men of letters were in danger
of chastisement from the poets or politicians whom they
criticised or vilified. De Foe often mentions attempts upon
his person. Pope, too, was threatened with a rod by
Ambrose Philips, which was hung up for his chastisement
in Button's Coffee-house; and at a later period, when his
satires had stirred up a nest of hornets, the poet was in the
habit of carrying pistols, and taking a large dog for his
companion when walking out at Twickenham.</p>

<p>Weddings within the liberties of the Fleet by sham
clergymen, or clergymen confined for debt, were the source
of numberless evils. Every kind of deception was practised,
and the victims once in the clutches of their reverend
captors had to pay heavily for the illegal ceremony. Ladies
were trepanned into matrimony, and Smollett in his <i>History</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
observes, that the Fleet parsons encouraged every kind of
villainy. It is astonishing that so great an evil in the
heart of London should have been allowed to exist so long,
and it was not until the Marriage Act of Lord Hardwicke
in 1753, which required the publication of banns, that the
Fleet marriages ceased. On the day before the Act came
into operation three hundred marriages are said to have
taken place.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Marriages of a more lawful kind were generally conducted
on business principles. Young women were expected
to accept the husband selected for them by their parents or
guardians, and the main object considered was to gain a
good settlement. It was for this that Mary Granville, who
is better known as Mrs. Delany, was sacrificed at seventeen
to a gouty old man of sixty, and when he died she was
expected to marry again with the same object in view.
Mrs. Delany detested, with good cause, the commercial
estimate of matrimony. Writing, in 1739, to Lady Throckmorton,
she says, 'Miss Campbell is to be married to-morrow
to my Lord Bruce. Her father can give her no
fortune; she is very pretty, modest, well-behaved, and just
eighteen, has two thousand a year jointure, and four
hundred pin-money; <i>they say</i> he is cross, covetous, and
threescore years old, and this unsuitable match is the
<i>admiration of the old and the envy of the young</i>! For my
part I <i>pity her</i>, for if she has any notion of social pleasures
that arise from true esteem and sensible conversation, how
miserable must she be.'<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Girls dowered with beauty or with fortune were not
always suffered to marry in this humdrum fashion. Ab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>duction
was by no means an imaginary peril. Mrs. Delany
tells the story of a lady in Ireland, from whom she received
the relation, who was entrapped in her uncle's house,
carried off by four men in masks, and treated in the most
brutal manner. And in 1711 the Duke of Newcastle,
having become acquainted with a design for carrying off
his daughter by force, was compelled to ask for a guard of
dragoons.</p>

<p>Duelling, against which Steele, De Foe, and Fielding
inveighed with courage and good sense, was a danger to
which every gentleman was liable who wore a sword.
Bullies were ready to provoke a quarrel, the slightest cause
of offence was magnified into an affair of honour, and the
lives of several of the most distinguished men of the
century were imperilled in this way. 'A gentleman,' Lord
Chesterfield writes, 'is every man who, with a tolerable
suit of clothes, a sword by his side, and a watch and snuffbox
in his pockets, asserts himself to be a gentleman,
swears with energy that he will be treated as such, and
that he will cut the throat of any man who presumes to say
the contrary.'</p>

<p>The foolish and evil custom died out slowly in this
kingdom. Even a great moralist like Dr. Johnson had
something to say in its defence, and Sir Walter Scott, who
might well have laughed to scorn any imputation of
cowardice, was prepared to accept a challenge in his old
age for a statement he had made in his <i>Life of Napoleon</i>.</p>

<p>Ladies had a different but equally doubtful mode of
asserting their gentility. On one occasion the Duchess of
Marlborough called on a lawyer without leaving her name.
'I could not make out who she was,' said the clerk afterwards,
'but she swore so dreadfully that she must be a
lady of quality.'</p>

<p>There was a fashion which our wits followed at this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
time that was not of English growth, namely, the tone of
gallantry in which they addressed ladies, no matter whether
single or married. Their compliments seemed like downright
love-making, and that frequently of a coarse kind,
but such expressions meant nothing, and were understood
to be a mere exercise of skill. Pope used them in writing
to Judith Cowper, whom he professes to worship as much
as any female saint in heaven; and in much ampler measure
when addressing Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, but neither
lady would have taken this amatory politeness seriously.
Thus he writes after an evening spent in Lady Mary's
society: 'Books have lost their effect upon me; and I was
convinced since I saw you, that there is something more
powerful than philosophy, and since I heard you, that there
is one alive wiser than all the sages.' He tells her that he
hates all other women for her sake; that none but her
guardian angels can have her more constantly in mind; and
that the sun has more reason to be proud of raising her
spirits 'than of raising all the plants and ripening all the
minerals in the earth.' He will fly to her in Italy at the
least notice and 'from thence,' he adds, 'how far you might
draw me and I might run after you, I no more know than
the spouse in the song of Solomon.'</p>

<p>This was the foible of an age in which women were
addressed as though they were totally devoid of understanding;
and Pope, as might have been expected, carried
the folly to excess.</p>

<p>Against another French custom Addison protests in the
<i>Spectator</i>, namely, that of women of rank receiving gentlemen
visitors in their bedrooms. He objects also to other
foreign habits introduced by 'travelled ladies,' and fears
that the peace, however much to be desired, may cause
the importation of a number of French fopperies. But
the proneness to follow the lead of France in matters of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
fashion is a folly not confined to the belles and beaux of
the last century.</p>

<p>If a chivalric regard for women be an indication of high
civilization, that sign is but faintly visible in the reigns of
Anne and of the first Georges. Sir Richard Steele paid a
noble tribute to Lady Elizabeth Hastings when he said
that to know her was a liberal education, but his contemporaries
usually treat women as pretty triflers, better fitted
to amuse men than to elevate them. Young takes this
view in his <i>Satires</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ladies supreme among amusements reign;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By nature born to soothe and entertain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their prudence in a share of folly lies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why will they be so weak as to be wise?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and Chesterfield, writing to his son, treats women with
similar contempt.... 'A man of sense,' he says, 'only trifles
with them, plays with them, humours and flatters them as he
does with a sprightly, forward child; but he neither consults
them about, nor trusts them with, serious matters,
though he often makes them believe that he does both,
which is the thing in the world that they are proud of....
No flattery is either too high or too low for them. They
will greedily swallow the highest and gratefully accept of
the lowest.'</p>

<p>Nearly twenty years passed, and then Chesterfield wrote
in the same contemptuous way of women in a letter to his
godson, a 'dear little boy' of ten.</p>

<p>'In company every woman is every man's superior, and
must be addressed with respect, nay, more, with flattery,
and you need not fear making it too strong ... it will be
greedily swallowed.'</p>

<p>Even Addison, while trying to instruct the 'Fair Sex' as
he likes to call them, apparently regarded its members as
an inferior order of beings. He delights to dwell upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
their foibles, on their dress, and on the thousand little
artifices practised by the flirt and the coquette. Here is
the view the Queen Anne moralist takes of the 'female
world' he was so eager to improve:</p>

<p>'I have often thought there has not been sufficient pains
in finding out proper employments and diversions for the
fair ones. Their amusements seem contrived for them,
rather as they are women, than as they are reasonable
creatures; and are more adapted to the sex than to the
species. The toilet is their great scene of business, and
the right adjustment of their hair the principal employment
of their lives. The sorting of a suit of ribands is
considered a very good morning's work; and if they make
an excursion to a mercer's or a toy-shop, so great a fatigue
makes them unfit for anything else all the day after.
Their more serious occupations are sewing and embroidery,
and their greatest drudgery the preparations of jellies and
sweetmeats. This I say is the state of ordinary women;
though I know there are multitudes of those that move in
an exalted sphere of knowledge and virtue, that join all
the beauties of the mind to the ornaments of dress, and
inspire a kind of awe and respect as well as of love into
their male beholders.'</p>

<p>The qualification made at the end of this description
does not greatly lessen the significance of the earlier
portion, which is Addison's picture, as he is careful to tell
us of 'ordinary women.' Much must be allowed for the
exaggeration of a humourist, but the frivolity of women is
a theme upon which Addison harps continually. Indeed,
were it not for this weakness in the 'feminine world' half
his vocation as a moralist in the <i>Spectator</i> would be gone,
and if the general estimate in his Essays of the women
with whom he was acquainted be to any extent a correct
one, the derogatory language used by men of letters, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
especially by Swift, Prior, Pope, and Chesterfield may be
almost forgiven.</p>

<p>It was the aim of Addison and Steele to represent, and
in some degree to caricature, the follies of fashionable life
in the Town. That life had also its vices, which, if less
unblushingly displayed than under the 'merry Monarch,'
were visible enough. 'In the eighteenth century,' says
Victor Hugo, in his epigrammatic way, 'the wife bolts out
her husband. She shuts herself up in Eden with Satan.
Adam is left outside.'</p>

<p>Drunkenness was a habit familiar to the fine gentlemen
of the town and to men occupying the highest position in
the State. Harley went more than once into the queen's
presence in a half-intoxicated condition; Carteret when
Secretary of State, if Horace Walpole may be credited, was
never sober; Bolingbroke, who practised every vice, is said
to have been a 'four-bottle man;' and Swift found it
perilous to dine with Ministers on account of the wine
which circulated at their tables. 'Prince Eugene,' he
writes, 'dines with the Secretary to-day with about seven
or eight general officers or foreign Ministers. They will
be all drunk I am sure.' Pope's frail body could not tolerate
excess, and he is said to have hastened his end by
good living. His friend Fenton 'died of a great chair and
two bottles of port a day.' Parnell, who seems to have
been in many respects a man of high character, is said to
have shortened his life by intemperance; and Gay, who was
cossetted like a favourite lapdog by the Duke and Duchess
of Queensberry, died from indolence and good living.</p>

<p>It may be questioned whether there is a single Wit
of the age who did not love port too well, like Addison
and Fenton, or suffer from 'carnivoracity' like Arbuthnot.
Every section of English society was infected with the
'devil drunkenness,' and the passion for gin created by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the encouragement of home distilleries produced a state of
crime, misery, and disease in London and in the country
which excited public attention. 'Small as is the place,'
writes Mr. Lecky, 'which this fact occupies in English
history, it was probably, if we consider all the consequences
that have flowed from it, the most momentous in that of
the eighteenth century&mdash;incomparably more so than any
event in the purely political or military annals of the
country.'<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The cruelty of the age is seen in a contempt for the feelings
of others, in the brutal punishments inflicted, in the amusements
then popular, and in a general contempt for human
suffering. Public executions were so frequent that they were
disregarded; and criminals of any note, like Dr. Dodd, were
exhibited in their cells for the gaolers' benefit prior to execution;
mad people in Bedlam, chained in their cells, also
formed one of the sights of London. As late as 1735 men
were pressed to death who refused to plead on a capital
charge; and women were publicly flogged, and were also
burnt at the stake by a law that was not repealed until
1794. Of the heads on Temple Bar, daily exposed to
Johnson's eyes in his beloved Fleet Street, we are reminded
by an apposite quotation of Goldsmith; and Samuel Rogers,
the banker-poet, who died as recently as 1855, remembered
having seen one there in his childhood. The public
exhibition of offenders in the pillory was not calculated to
refine the manners of the people. It afforded a cruel entertainment
to the mob, who may be said to have baited these
poor victims as they were accustomed to bait bulls and
bears. Every kind of offensive missile was thrown at them,
and sometimes the strokes proved deadly.</p>

<p>Men who could thus torture a human being were not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
likely to abstain from cruelty to the lower animals. The
poets indeed protested then, as poets had done before, and
always have done since, against the unmanly treatment of
the dumb fellow-creatures committed to our care, but their
voices were little heeded, and even the Prince of Wales
visited Hockley-in-the-Hole, in disguise, to witness the torturing
of bulls. 'The gladiatorian and other sanguinary
sports,' says the author of the <i>Characteristics</i>, 'which we
allow our people, discover sufficiently our national taste.
And the baitings and slaughters of so many sorts of
creatures, tame as well as wild, for diversion merely, may
witness the extraordinary inclination we have for amphitheatrical
spectacles.'<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The majesty of the law was maintained by disembowelling
traitors, by cutting off the ears, or branding the cheeks
of political offenders, and by the penalties inflicted on
Roman Catholics, and on Protestant dissenters. Men who
deemed themselves honourable gained power through
bribery and intrigue. It was through a king's mistress
and a heavy bribe that Bolingbroke was enabled to return
from exile; Chesterfield intrigued against Newcastle with
the Duchess of Yarmouth; and clergymen eager for promotion
had no scruple in paying court to women who had
lost their virtue.</p>

<p>Never, unless perhaps during the Civil War, was the
spirit of party more rampant in the country. Patriotism
was a virtue more talked about than felt, and in the cause
of faction private characters were assailed and libels circulated
through the press. Addison, who did more than any
other writer to humanize his age, saw the evil of the time
and struck a blow at it with his inimitable humour. The
<i>Spectator</i> discovers, on his journey to Sir Roger de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Coverley's house, that the knight's Toryism grew with the
miles that separated him from London:</p>

<p>'In all our journey from London to his house we did not
so much as bait at a Whig inn; or if by chance the coachman
stopped at a wrong place, one of Sir Roger's servants
would ride up to his master full speed, and whisper to
him that the master of the house was against such an one
in the last election. This often betrayed us into hard beds
and bad cheer; for we were not so inquisitive about the
inn as the innkeeper; and provided our landlord's principles
were sound did not take any notice of the staleness
of his provisions. This I found still the more inconvenient,
because the better the host was, the worse generally were
his accommodations; the fellow knowing very well that
those who were his friends would take up with coarse diet
and hard lodging. For these reasons, all the while I was
upon the road, I dreaded entering into an house of anyone
that Sir Roger had applauded for an honest man.'<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Against the party zeal of female politicians Addison indulges
frequently in humorous sallies. He assures them
that it gives an ill-natured cast to the eye, and flushes the
cheeks worse than brandy. Party rage, he says, is a male
vice, and is altogether repugnant 'to the softness, the
modesty, and those other endearing qualities which are
natural to the fair sex.'</p>

<p>'When I have seen a pretty mouth uttering calumnies
and invectives, what would I not have given to have stopt
it? how have I been troubled to see some of the finest
features in the world grow pale and tremble with party
rage. Camilla is one of the greatest beauties in the
British nation, and yet values herself more upon being
the virago of one party than upon being the toast of both.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
The dear creature about a week ago encountered the fierce
and beautiful Penthesilea across a tea-table; but in the
height of her anger, as her hand chanced to shake with the
earnestness of the dispute, she scalded her fingers, and
spilt a dish of tea upon her petticoat. Had not this accident
broke off the debate, nobody knows where it would
have ended.'</p>

<p>The coffee-houses in which men aired their wit and discussed
the news of the day were wholly dominated by party.
'A Whig,' says De Foe, 'will no more go to the Cocoa
Tree or Ozinda's than a Tory will be seen at the coffee-house
of St. James's.' Swift declared that the Whig and
Tory animosity infected even the dogs and cats. It was
inevitable that it should also infect literature. Books were
seldom judged on their merits, the praise or blame being
generally awarded according to the political principles of
their authors. An impartial literary journal did not exist
in the days when Addison 'gave his little senate laws' at
Button's, and perhaps it does not exist now, but if critical
injustice be done in our day it is rarely owing to political
causes.</p>

<p>One of the most prominent vices of the time was gambling,
which was largely encouraged by the public lotteries, and
practised by all classes of the people. This evil was exhibited
on a national scale by the establishment of the South
Sea Company, which exploded in 1720, after creating a
madness for speculation never known before or since.
Even men who like Sir Robert Walpole kept their heads,
and saw that the bubble would soon burst, invested in
stock. Pope had his share in the speculation, and might,
had he 'realized' in time, have been the 'lord of thousands;'
in the end, however, he was a gainer, though not to a large

beggary. The South Sea Bubble and the Mississippi
scheme of Law which burst in the same year and ruined
tens of thousands of French families, afford illustrations
on a gigantic scale of the prevailing passion for speculation
and for gambling.</p>

<p>'The Duke of Devonshire lost an estate at a game of
basset. The fine intellect of Chesterfield was thoroughly
enslaved by the vice. At Bath, which was then the centre
of English fashion, it reigned supreme; and the physicians
even recommended it to their patients as a form of distraction.
In the green-rooms of the theatres, as Mrs. Bellamy
assures us, thousands were often lost and won in a single
night. Among fashionable ladies the passion was quite as
strong as among men, and the professor of whist and
quadrille became a regular attendant at their levees. Miss
Pelham, the daughter of the prime minister, was one of
the most notorious gamblers of her time, and Lady Cowper
speaks in her <i>Diary</i> of sittings at Court, of which the
lowest stake was 200 guineas. The public lotteries contributed
very powerfully to diffuse the taste for gambling
among all classes.'<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>One of the most powerful exponents of the dark side of
the century is Hogarth, who makes some of its worst
features live before our eyes. So also do the novels of
Richardson, Fielding, and Smollett. Differing as their
works do in character, they have the common merit of
presenting in indelible lines a picture of the time in its
social aspects. It may have been, as Stuart Mill asserts, an
age of strong men, but it was an age of coarse vices, an
age wanting in the refinements and graces of life; an age of
cruel punishments, cruel sports, and of a political corruption
extending through all the departments of the State.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>
<p>But it would be a narrow view of the age to dwell wholly
on its gloomier features, which are always the easiest to
detect. If the period under consideration had prominent
vices, it had also distinguished merits. Under Queen
Anne and her immediate successors, home-keeping Englishmen
had more space to breathe in than they have now,
and trade was not demoralized by excessive competition.
No attempt was made to separate class from class, and
population was not large enough to make the battle of life
almost hopeless in the lowest section of the community. If
there was less refinement than among ourselves, there was
far less of nervous susceptibility, and the country was free
from the half-educated class of men and women who know
enough to make them dissatisfied, without attaining to the
larger knowledge which yields wisdom and content. To
say that the age was better than our own would be to deny
a thousand signs of material and intellectual progress, but
it had fewer dangers to contend with, and if there was far
less of wealth in the country the people were probably more
satisfied with their lot.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>To glance at the century as a whole does not fall within
my province, but I may be permitted to observe that in the
course of it science and invention made rapid strides; that
under the inspiring sway of Handel the power of music
was felt as it was never felt before; that in the latter half of
the period the Novel, destined to be one of the noblest
fruits of our imaginative literature, attained a robust life
in the hands of Richardson, Fielding, and Smollett; and
that, with Reynolds and Gainsborough, with Romney and
Wilson, a glorious school of landscape and portrait
painters arose, which is still the pride of England. It will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
be remembered, too, that many of the great charitable
institutions which make our own age illustrious, had their
birth in the last. The military genius of England was
displayed in Marlborough and in Clive, her mercy in John
Howard, her spirit of enterprise in Cook, her self-sacrifice
in Wesley and Whitefield, her statesmanship in Walpole,
in Chatham, and in William Pitt. In oratory as everyone
knows, the eighteenth century was surpassingly great, and
never before or since has the country produced a political
philosopher of the calibre of Burke. What England reaped
in literature during the period of which Pope has been
selected as the most striking figure, it will be my endeavour
to show in the course of these pages.</p>

<h3>ALEXANDER POPE.</h3>


<p>It is not unreasonable to call the period we are considering
'the Age of Pope.' He is the representative poet of his
century. Its literary merits and defects are alike conspicuous
in his verse, and he stands immeasurably above
the numerous versifiers who may be said to belong to his
school. Savage Landor has observed that there is no such
thing as a school of poetry, and this is true in the sense
that the essence of this divine art cannot be transmitted,
but the form of the art may be, and Pope's style of workmanship
made it readily imitable by accomplished craftsmen.
Although he affected to call poetry an idle trade he
devoted his whole life to its pursuit, and there are few
instances in literature in which genius and unwearied
labour have been so successfully united. It is to Pope's
credit, that, with everything against him in the race of
life, he attained the goal for which he started in his
youth. The means he employed to reach it were frequently
perverse and discreditable, but the courage with which
he overcame the obstacles in his path commands our
admiration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alexander Pope
(1688-1744).</div>

<p>Alexander Pope was born in London on May 21st, 1688.
He was the only son of his father, a merchant
or tradesman, and a Roman Catholic
at a time when the members of that church
were proscribed by law. The boy was a cripple from his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
birth, and suffered from great bodily weakness both in youth
and manhood. Looking back upon his life in after years
he called it a 'long disease.' The elder Pope seems to have
retired from business soon after his son's birth, and at
Binfield, nine miles from Windsor, twenty-seven years of
the poet's life were spent. As a 'papist' Pope was excluded
from the Universities and from every public career, but
even under happier circumstances his health would have
condemned him to a secluded life. He gained some instruction
from the family priest, and also went for a short time
to school, but for the most part he was self-educated, and
studied so severely that at seventeen his life was probably
saved by the sound advice of Dr. Radcliffe to read less
and to ride on horseback every day. The rhyming faculty
was very early developed, and to use his own phrase he
'lisped in numbers.' As a boy he felt the magic of Spenser,
whose enchanting sweetness and boundless wealth of imagination
have been now for three hundred years a joy to
every lover of poetry. Something, too, he learned from
Waller and from Sandys, both of whom, but especially the
former, had been of service in giving smoothness to the
iambic distich, in which all of Pope's best poems are
written. Dryden, however, whom when a little boy he saw
at Will's coffee-house&mdash;'<i>Virgilium tantum vidi</i>' records the
memorable day&mdash;was the poet whose influence he felt most
powerfully. Like Gray several years later, he declared
that he learnt versification wholly from his works. From
'knowing Walsh,' the best critic in the nation in Dryden's
opinion, the youthful Pope received much friendly counsel;
and he had another wise friend in Sir William Trumbull,
formerly Secretary of State, who recognized his genius, and
gave him as warm a friendship as an old man can offer
to a young one. The dissolute Restoration dramatist,
Wycherley, was also his temporary companion. The old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
man, if Pope's story be true, asked him to correct his
poems, which are indeed beyond correction, as the youthful
critic appears to have hinted, and the two parted
company.</p>

<p>The <i>Pastorals</i>, written, according to Pope's assertion, at
the age of sixteen, were published in 1709, and won an
amount of praise incomprehensible in the present day. Mr.
Leslie Stephen has happily appraised their value in calling
them 'mere school-boy exercises.' Not thus, however,
were they regarded by the poet, or by the critics of his age,
yet neither he nor they could have divined the rapid progress
of his fame, and that in about six years' time he
would be regarded as the greatest of living poets. The
<i>Essay on Criticism</i>, written, it appears, in 1709, was published
two years later, and received the highest honour
a poem could then have. It was praised by Addison in
the <i>Spectator</i> as 'a very fine poem,' and 'a masterpiece
in its kind.' The 'kind,' suggested by the <i>Ars Poetica</i> of
Horace, and the <i>Art Poétique</i> of Boileau&mdash;translated with
Dryden's help by Sir William Soame&mdash;suited the current
taste for criticism and argument in rhyme, which had led
Roscommon to write an <i>Essay on Translated Verse</i>, and
Sheffield an <i>Essay on Poetry</i>. The <i>Essay on Criticism</i> is a
marvellous production for a young man who had scarcely
passed his maturity when it was published. To have
written lines and couplets that live still in the language
and are on everyone's lips is an achievement of which any
poet might be proud, and there are at least twenty such
lines or couplets in the poem.</p>

<p>In 1713 <i>Windsor Forest</i> appeared. Through the most
susceptible years of life the poet had lived in the country,
but Nature and Pope were not destined to become friends;
he looked at her 'through the spectacles of books' and his
description of natural objects is invariably of the conven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>tional
type. Although never a resident in London he was
unable in the exercise of his art to breathe any atmosphere
save that of the town, and might have said, in the
words of Lessing to his friend Kleist, 'When you go to
the country I go to the coffee-house.'<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The use, or as it would be more correct to say the abuse,
of classical mythology in the description of rural scenes
had the sanction of great names, and Pope was not likely
to reject what Spenser and Milton had sanctioned. Gods
and goddesses therefore play a conspicuous part in his description
of the Forest. The following lines afford a fair
illustration of the style throughout, and the sole merit of
the poem is the smoothness of versification in which Pope
excelled.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Not proud Olympus yields a nobler sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though gods assembled grace his towering height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than what more humble mountains offer here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When in their blessings all those gods appear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See Pan with flocks, with fruits Pomona crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here blushing Flora paints th' enamelled ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here Ceres' gifts in waving prospect stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nodding tempt the joyful reaper's hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich Industry sits smiling on the plains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And peace and plenty tell a Stuart reigns.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Pope, who was never known to laugh, was a great wit,
but his sense of humour was small, and the descent
from these deities to Queen Anne savours not a little of
bathos.</p>

<p>In 1712 Pope had published <i>The Rape of the Lock</i>, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Addison justly praised as 'a delicious little thing.' At the
same time he advised the poet not to attempt improving it,
which he proposed to do, and Pope most unreasonably
attributed this advice to jealousy. In 1714 the delightful
poem appeared in its present form with the machinery of
sylphs and gnomes adopted from the mysteries of the Rosicrucians.
Pope styles it an heroi-comical poem, and judged
in the light of a burlesque it is conceived and executed with
an art that is beyond praise. Lord Petre, a Roman Catholic
peer, had cut off a lock of Miss Arabella Fermor's hair,
much to the indignation of her family and possibly of the
young lady also. Pope wrote the poem to remove the discord
caused by the fatal shears, but its publication, and
two or three offensive allusions it contained, only served to
add to Miss Fermor's annoyance. 'The celebrated lady
herself,' the poet wrote, 'is offended, and which is stranger,
not at herself but me. Is not this enough to make a writer
never be tender of another's character or fame?' But
Pope, whose praise of women is too often a libel upon
them, was not as tender as he ought to have been of the
lady's reputation.</p>

<p>The offence felt by the heroine of the poem is now unheeded;
the dainty art exhibited is a permanent delight,
and our language can boast no more perfect specimen of
the poetical burlesque than the <i>Rape of the Lock</i>. The
machinery of the sylphs is managed with perfect skill, and
nothing can be more admirable than the charge delivered
by Ariel to the sylphs to guard Belinda from an apprehended
but unknown danger. The concluding lines shall
be quoted:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Whatever spirit, careless of his charge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His post neglects, or leaves the fair at large,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be stopped in vials, or transfixed with pins;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or plunged in lakes of bitter washes lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or wedged, whole ages, in a bodkin's eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While clogged he beats his silken wings in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or alum styptics, with contracting power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrink his thin essence like a rivelled flower;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, as Ixion fixed, the wretch shall feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The giddy motion of the whirling mill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fumes of burning chocolate shall glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tremble at the sea that froths below!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another striking portion of the poem is the description
of the Spanish game of Ombre, imitated from Vida's
<i>Scacchia Ludus</i>. 'Vida's poem,' says Mr. Elwin, 'is a
triumph of ingenuity, when the intricacy of chess is considered,
and the difficulty of expressing the moves in a dead
language. Yet the original is eclipsed by Pope's more
consummate copy.'<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Many famous passages illustrative of Pope's art might
be extracted from this poem, but it will suffice to give the
portrait of Belinda:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'On her white breast a sparkling cross she wore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Jews might kiss and infidels adore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quick as her eyes and as unfixed as those;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Favours to none, to all she smiles extends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft she rejects, but never once offends.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright as the sun her eyes the gazers strike,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like the sun, they shine on all alike.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet graceful ease, and sweetness void of pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might hide her faults, if belles had faults to hide:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If to her share some female errors fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look on her face and you'll forget them all.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The <i>Temple of Fame</i>, a liberal paraphrase of Chaucer's
<i>House of Fame</i>, followed in 1715, and despite the praise of
Steele, who declared that it had a thousand beauties, and of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Dr. Johnson, who observes that every part is splendid, must
be pronounced one of Pope's least attractive pieces. Two
poems of the emotional and sentimental class, <i>Eloisa to
Abelard</i> and the <i>Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate
Lady</i> (1717), are more worthy of attention. Nowhere, probably,
in the language are finer specimens to be met with of
rhetorical pathos, but poets like Burns, Cowper, Wordsworth,
and Tennyson can touch the heart more deeply by
a phrase or couplet than Pope is able to do by his elaborate
representations of passion. The reader is not likely to be
affected by the following response of Eloisa to an invitation
from the spirit world:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I come, I come! prepare your roseate bowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Celestial palms and ever-blooming flowers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thither, where sinners may have rest, I go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where flames refined in breasts seraphic glow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, Abelard! the last sad office pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smooth my passage to the realms of day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See my lips tremble and my eye-balls roll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suck my last breath and catch my flying soul!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah no&mdash;in sacred vestments may'st thou stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hallowed taper trembling in thy hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Present the Cross before my lifted eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Teach me at once and learn of me to die.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The music or the fervour of the poem delighted Porson,
famous for his Greek and his potations, and whether drunk
or sober he would recite, or rather sing it, from the beginning
to the end. The felicity of the versification is incontestable,
but at the same time artifice is more visible than nature
throughout the Epistle, and this is true also of <i>The Elegy</i>,
a composition in which Pope's method of treating mournful
topics is excellently displayed. The opening lines are suggested
by Ben Jonson's <i>Elegy on the Marchioness of Winchester</i>,
a lady whose death was also lamented by Milton.
These we shall not quote, but take in preference a passage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
which is perhaps as graceful an expression of poetical
rhetoric as can be found in Pope's verse.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'By foreign hands thy dying eyes were closed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By foreign hands thy decent limbs composed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By foreign hands thy humble grave adorned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By strangers honoured, and by strangers mourned!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What though no friends in sable weeds appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grieve for an hour, perhaps, then mourn a year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bear about the mockery of woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To midnight dances and the public show?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What though no weeping Loves thy ashes grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor polished marble emulate thy face?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What though no sacred earth allow thee room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor hallowed dirge be muttered o'er thy tomb?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet shall thy grave with rising flowers be drest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the green turf lie lightly on thy breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There the first roses of the year shall blow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While angels with their silver wings o'ershade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ground, now sacred by thy reliques made.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For some years Pope had been brooding over and slowly
labouring at a task which was destined to add greatly to
his fame and also to his fortune.</p>

<p>In 1708 his early friend, Sir William Trumbull, had
advised him to translate the <i>Iliad</i>, and five years later the
poet, following the custom of the age, invited subscriptions
to the work, which was to appear in six volumes at the
price of six guineas. About this time Swift, who by the aid
of his powerful pen was assisting Harley and St. John to
rule the country, made Pope's acquaintance, and ultimately
became perhaps the most faithful of his friends. Swift,
who was able to help everybody but himself, zealously
promoted the poet's scheme, and was heard to say at the
coffee-houses that 'the best poet in England Mr. Pope a
Papist' had begun a translation of Homer which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
should not print till he had a thousand guineas for
him.</p>

<p>He was not satisfied with this service, but introduced the
poet to St. John, Atterbury, and Harley. The first volume
of Pope's <i>Homer</i> appeared in 1715, and in the same year
Addison's friend Tickell published his version of the first
book of the <i>Iliad</i>. Pope affected to believe that this was
done at Addison's instigation.</p>

<p>Already, as we have said, there had been a misunderstanding
between the two famous wits, and Pope, whose
irritable temperament led him into many quarrels and
created a host of enemies, ceased from this time to regard
Addison as a friend. Probably neither of them can be
exempted from blame, and we can well believe that Addison,
whose supremacy had formerly been uncontested,
could not without some jealousy 'bear a brother near the
throne,' but the chief interest of the estrangement to the
literary student is the famous satire written at a later date,
in which Addison appears under the character of Atticus.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
It is necessary to add here that the whole story of the
quarrel comes to us from Pope, who is never to be trusted,
either in prose or verse, when he wishes to excuse himself
at the expense of a rival.</p>

<p>Pope had no cause for discontent at his position; not
even the strife of parties stood in the way of his <i>Homer</i>,
which was praised alike by Whig and Tory, and brought
the translator a fortune. It has been calculated that the
entire version of the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>, the payments for
which covered eleven years, yielded Pope a clear profit of
about £9,000, and it is said to have made at the same time
the fortune of his publisher. Pope, I believe, was the first
poet who, without the aid of patronage or of the stage, was
able to live in comfort from the sale of his works.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>
<p>He knew how to value money, but fame was dearer to
him than wealth, and of both he had now enough to satisfy
his ambition. Posterity has not endorsed the general
verdict of his contemporaries on his famous translation.
He had to encounter indeed some severe comments, and
Richard Bentley, the greatest classical scholar then living,
must have vexed the sensitive poet when he told him
that his version was a pretty poem but he must not call
it Homer. By this criticism, however, as Matthew
Arnold has observed, the work is judged in spite of all its
power and attractiveness. Pope wants Homer's simplicity
and directness, and his artifices of style are utterly alien
to the Homeric spirit. Dr. Johnson quotes the judgment
of critics who say that Pope's <i>Homer</i> 'exhibits no resemblance
of the original and characteristic manner of the
Father of Poetry, as it wants his awful simplicity, his artless
grandeur, his unaffected majesty,' and observes that
this cannot be totally denied. He argues, however, that
even in Virgil's time the demand for elegance had been so
much increased that mere nature could be endured no
longer, that every age improves in elegance, that if some
Ovidian graces are, alas! not to be found in the English
<i>Iliad</i> 'to have added can be no great crime if nothing be
taken away.' Johnson was not aware that to add 'poetical
elegances' to the words and thoughts of a great poet is to
destroy much of the beauty of his verse and many of its
most striking characteristics. As well might he say that
the beauty of a lovely woman can be enhanced by a profusion
of trinkets, or that a Greek statue would be more
worthy of admiration if it were elegantly dressed. Dr.
Johnson says, with perfect truth, that Pope wrote for his
own age, and it may be added that he exhibits extraordinary
art in ministering to the taste of the age; yet it is hardly
too much to affirm that in the exercise of his craft as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
translator he is continually false to nature and therefore
false to Homer.</p>

<p>On the other hand his <i>Iliad</i> if read as a story runs so
smoothly, that the reader, and especially the young reader,
is carried through the narrative without any sense of
fatigue. It is not a little praise to say that it is a poem
which every school-boy will read with pleasure, and in which
every critical reader who is content to surrender his judgment
for awhile, will find pleasure also. Mr. Courthope in
his elaborate and masterly <i>Life of Pope</i>, which gives the
coping stone to an exhaustive edition of the poet's works,
praises a fine passage from the <i>Iliad</i>, which in his judgment
attains perhaps the highest level of which the heroic
couplet is capable, and 'I do not believe,' he adds, 'that
any Englishman of taste and imagination can read the
lines without feeling that if Pope had produced nothing
but his translation of Homer, he would be entitled to the
praise of a great original poet.'</p>

<p>Pope's editor could not perhaps have selected a better
illustration of his best manner than this speech of Sarpedon
to Glaucus, which is parodied in the <i>Rape of the Lock</i>.
The concluding lines shall be quoted.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Could all our care elude the gloomy grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which claims no less the fearful than the brave,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>We may add that neither its false glitter nor Pope's
inability&mdash;shared in great measure with every translator&mdash;to
catch the spirit of the original, can conceal the sustained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
power of this brilliant work. Its merit is the more wonderful
since the poet's knowledge of Greek was extremely
meagre, and he is said to have been constantly indebted to
earlier translations. Gibbon said that his <i>Homer</i> had
every merit except that of faithfulness to the original; and
Pope, could he have heard it, might well have been satisfied
with the verdict of Gray, a great scholar as well as a
great poet, that no other version would ever equal his.</p>

<p>All that has been hitherto said with regard to Pope and
Homer relates to his version of the <i>Iliad</i>. On that he
expended his best powers, and on that it is evident he
bestowed infinite pains. The <i>Odyssey</i>, one of the most
beautiful stories in the world, appears to have been taken
up with a weary pen, and in putting it into English he
sought the assistance of Broome and Fenton, two minor
poets and Cambridge scholars. They translated twelve
books out of the twenty-four, and so skilfully did they
catch Pope's style that it is almost impossible to discern
any difference between his work and theirs. The literary
partnership led to one of Pope's discreditable man&oelig;uvres,
in which, strange to say, he was assisted by Broome, whom
he induced to set his name to a falsehood. Pope as we
have said, translated twelve books, while eight were allotted
to Broome and four to Fenton. Yet he led Broome,
unknown to his colleague, to ascribe only three books to
himself and two to Fenton, and at the same time the poet,
who confessed that he could 'equivocate pretty genteely,'
stated the amount he had paid for Broome's eight books
as if it had been paid for three. The story is disgraceful
both to Pope and Broome, and why the latter should have
practised such a deception is unaccountable. He was a
beneficed clergyman and a man of wealth, so that he could
not have lied for money even if Pope had been willing to
bribe him. Fenton was indignant, as he well might be,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
but he was too lazy or too good-natured to expose the
fraud. Broome had his deserts later on, but Pope, who
ridiculed him in the <i>Dunciad</i>, and in his <i>Treatise on the
Bathos</i>, was the last man in the world entitled to render
them.</p>

<p>The partnership in poetry which produced the <i>Odyssey</i>
was not a great literary success, and most readers will
prefer the version of Cowper, whose blank verse, though
out of harmony with the rapid movement of the <i>Iliad</i> is
not unfitted for the quieter beauties of the <i>Odyssey</i>.</p>

<p>In 1721, prior to the publication of his version, the
poet had agreed to edit an edition of Shakespeare, a task
as difficult as any which a man of letters can undertake.
Pope was not qualified to achieve it. He was comparatively
ignorant of Elizabethan literature, the dry labours
of an editor were not to his taste, and he lacked true
sympathy with the genius of the poet. Failure was
therefore inevitable, and Theobald, who has some solid
merits as a commentator, found it easy to discern and
to expose the errors of Pope. For doing so he was afterwards
'hitched' into the <i>Dunciad</i>, and made in the first
instance its hero. The "Shakespeare" was published
in 1725 in six volumes quarto. 'Its chief claim,' Mr.
Courthope writes, 'to interest at the present day, is that
it forms the immediate starting-point for the long succession
of Pope's satires.... The vexation caused to the
poet by the undoubted justice of many of Theobald's strictures
procured for the latter the unwelcome honour of
being recognized as the King of the Dunces, and coupled
with Bentley's disparaging mention of the Translation of
the <i>Iliad</i> provoked the many contemptuous allusions to
verbal criticism in Pope's later satires.'<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<p>A striking peculiarity of Pope's art may be mentioned
here. He was able only to play on one instrument, the
heroic couplet. When he attempted any other form of
verse the result, if not total failure, was mediocrity. It
was a daring act of Pope to suggest by his <i>Ode on St.
Cecilia's Day</i>, a comparison with the <i>Alexander's Feast</i> of
Dryden. The performance is perfunctory rather than
spontaneous, and the few lyrical efforts he attempted in
addition, show no ear for music. The voice of song with
which even the minor poets of the Elizabethan age were
gifted was silent in England, though not in Scotland, during
the first half of the eighteenth century, or if a faint note is
occasionally heard, as in the lyrics of Gay, it is without the
grace and joyous freedom of the earlier singers. Not that
the lyrical form was wanting; many minor versifiers, like
Hughes, Sheffield, Granville, and Somerville, wrote what they
called songs, but unfortunately without an ear for singing.</p>

<p>In this short summary and criticism of a poet's literary
life it would be out of place to insert many biographical
details, were it not that, in the case of Pope, the student
who knows little or nothing of the man will fail to understand
his poetry. A distinguished critic has said that the
more we know of Pope's age the better shall we understand
Pope. With equal truth it may be said that a familiarity
with the poet's personal character is essential to an adequate
appreciation of his genius. His friendships, his
enmities, his mode of life at Twickenham, the entangled
tale of his correspondence, his intrigues in the pursuit of
fame, his constitutional infirmities, the personal character
of his satires, these are a few of the prominent topics with
which a student of the poet must make himself conversant.
It may be well, therefore, to give the history in brief outline,
and we have now reached the crisis in his fortunes which
will conveniently enable us to do so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1716 Pope's family had removed from Binfield to
Chiswick. A year later he lost his father, to whose memory
he has left a filial tribute, and shortly afterwards he bought
the small estate of five acres at Twickenham with which
his name is so intimately associated. Before reaching the
age of thirty Pope was regarded as the first of living poets.
His income more than sufficed for all his wants. At
Twickenham the great in intellect, and the great by birth,
met around his table; he was welcomed by the highest
society in the land, and although proud of his intimacy
with the nobility, 'unplaced, unpensioned,' he was 'no
man's heir or slave,' and jealously preserved his independence.
'Pope,' says Johnson, 'never set genius to sale,
he never flattered those whom he did not love, or praised
those whom he did not esteem,' and he was, we may add,
in this respect a striking contrast to Dryden, who lavished
his flatteries wholesale.</p>

<p>With a mother to whom he was tenderly attached, with
troops of friends, with an undisputed supremacy in the
world of letters, and with a vocation that was the joy of
his heart,&mdash;if possessions like these can confer happiness,
Pope should have been a happy man.</p>

<p>But his 'crazy carcass,' as the painter Jervas called
it, was united to the most suspicious and irritable of
temperaments, and the fine wine of his poetry was
rarely free from bitterness in the cup. Pope could be a
warm friend, but was not always a faithful one, and even
women whose friendship he had enjoyed suffered from
the venom of his satire. He was not a man to rise above
his age, and it would be charitable to ascribe a portion of
his grossness to it. Voltaire is said by his loose talk to
have driven Pope's good old mother from the table at
Twickenham; Walpole's language not only in his home at
Houghton, but at Court, was insufferably coarse; and Pope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
wrote to ladies in language that must have disgusted
modest women even in his free-speaking day. His foul
lines on Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, to whom he had
formerly written in a most ridiculous strain of gallantry,
and to whom he is said to have made love,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> cannot easily
be characterized in moderate language. Lady Mary had
little delicacy herself, but the poet, who thought himself
a gentleman, had no excuse for abusing her. Excuses
indeed are not easily to be offered for Pope's moral defalcations.
His life was a series of petty intrigues, trickeries,
and deceptions. He could not, it has been said,&mdash;the
conceit is borrowed from Young's <i>Satires</i>&mdash;'take his
tea without a stratagem,' and knew how to utter the
loftiest sentiments while acting the most contemptible of
parts.</p>

<p>The long and intricate deceptions which he practised to
secure the publication of his letters, while so manipulating
them as to enhance his credit, were suspected to some
extent in his own age, and have been painfully laid bare in
ours. It is an amazing story, which may be read at large
in Mr. Dilke's <i>Papers of a Critic</i>, or in the elaborate narrative
of Mr. Elwin in the first volume of his edition of <i>Pope</i>.
It will be there seen how the poet compiled fictitious letters,
suppressed passages, altered dates, manufactured letters
out of other letters, and secretly enabled the infamous
bookseller Curll to publish his correspondence surreptitiously
in order that he might have the excuse for printing
it himself in a more carefully prepared form. The worst
feature of the miserable story is the poet's conduct with
regard to Swift, his oldest and most faithful friend. On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
this subject the writer may be allowed to quote what he
has said elsewhere.</p>

<p>'Years before, Swift, who cared little for literary reputation,
and never resorted to any artifice to promote it, had
suspected Pope of a desire to make literary capital out of
their correspondence, and the poet had excused himself
according to his wonted fashion. After the publication by
Curll, he begged Swift to return him his letters lest they
should fall into the bookseller's hands. The Dean replied, no
doubt to Pope's infinite chagrin, that they were safe in his
keeping, as he had given strict orders in his will that his
executors should burn every letter he might leave behind
him. Afterwards he promised that Pope should eventually
have them but declined giving them up during his lifetime.
Hereupon Pope changed his tactics and begged that he
might have the letters to print. The publication by Curll
of two letters (probably another <i>ruse</i> of Pope's) formed an
additional ground for urging his request. All his efforts
were unavailing until he obtained the assistance of Lord
Orrery, to whom Swift was at length induced to deliver up
the letters. There was a hiatus in the correspondence and
Pope took advantage of this and of a blunder made by
Swift, whose memory at the time was not to be trusted, to
hint, what he dared not directly assert, that the bulk of the
collection remained with the Dean, and that Swift's own
letters had been returned to him. We have now irresistible
proof that the Dublin edition of the letters was taken from
an impression sent from England and sent by Pope. Nor
was this all. The poet acted with still greater meanness,
for he had the audacity to deplore the sad vanity of Swift
in permitting the publication of his correspondence, and to
declare that "no decay of body is half so miserable."'<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>
<p>That he had many fine qualities in spite of the littlenesses
which mar his character one would be loath to doubt. Among
his nobler traits was an ardent passion for literature, a
courage which enabled him to face innumerable obstacles&mdash;'Pope,'
says Mr. Swinburne, 'was as bold as a lion'&mdash;and
a constant devotion to his parents, especially to his
mother, who lived to a great age. There are no sincerer
words in his letters than those which relate to Mrs. Pope.
'It is my mother only,' he once wrote, regretting his inability
to leave home, 'that robs me of half the pleasure of
my life, and that gives me the greatest at the same time,'
and the lines expressing his affection for her are familiar to
most readers. Truly does Johnson say that 'life has among
its soothing and quiet comforts few things better to give
than such a son.'</p>

<p>Among his lady friends the dearest was Martha Blount,
the younger of two beautiful sisters, of whom Gay sang as
'the fair-haired Martha and Teresa brown.' They came
of an old Roman Catholic family residing at Mapledurham,
and were little more than girls when Pope first knew them.
With the elder sister he quarrelled, but Martha was faithful
to him for life, and when he was dying it is said that her
coming in 'gave a new turn of spirits or a temporary strength
to him.' Swift, as we have said, was one of the warmest
of Pope's friends, and his letters to the poet are by far the
most attractive portion of the published correspondence.
He visited him at Twickenham more than once, and on
one occasion spent some months under his roof. Bolingbroke,
his 'guide, philosopher, and friend,' who for a time
lived near to him at Dawley, was a frequent guest, so also,
in the days of their intimacy, was Lady Mary, who had a
house at Twickenham. Thomson the poet, too, lived not
far off, and was visited by his brother bard, whom Thomson's
barber describes as 'a strange, ill-formed, little figure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
of a man,' but he adds, 'I have heard him and Quin and
Patterson<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> talk so together that I could have listened to
them for ever.' Arbuthnot, one of the finest wits and best
men of his time, who, as Swift said, could do everything
but walk, was also a faithful friend of Pope; so was
Gay, and so was Bishop Atterbury, who, as the poet
said, first taught him to think "as becomes a reasonable
creature."</p>

<p>James Craggs, who had been formerly Secretary of State,
and was on the warmest terms of intimacy with the poet,
resided for some time near his friend in order to enjoy the
pleasure of his society. When in office he proposed to pay
him a pension of £300 a year out of the secret service
money, but Pope declined the offer. Statesmen and men
of active pursuits cultivated the society of the poetical
recluse, and Pope, whose compliments are monuments
more enduring than marble, has recorded their visits to
Twickenham:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'There, my retreat the best companions grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chiefs out of war, and statesmen out of place,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now forms my quincunx and now ranks my vines.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Among Pope's associates was the 'blameless Bethel,'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'&mdash;&mdash; who always speaks his thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And always thinks the very thing he ought,'<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></div></div>

<p>and Berkeley who had 'every virtue under heaven,' and
Lord Bathurst who was unspoiled by wealth and joined</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>and 'humble Allen' who</p>

<span class="i0">'Did good by stealth and blushed to find it fame;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and many another friend who lives in his verse and is
secure of the immortality a poet can confer.</p>

<p>The five volumes which contain the letters between Pope
and his friends exhibit an interesting picture of the times
and of the writers. The poet's own letters, as may be supposed
from the thought he bestowed on them, are full of artifice,
and composed with the most elaborate care. Every sentence
is elaborately turned, and the ease and naturalness which
give a charm to the letters of Cowper and of Southey are
not to be found in Pope. His epistles are weighted with
compliments and with professions of the most exalted
morality. 'He laboured them,' says Horace Walpole, 'as
much as the <i>Essay on Man</i>, and as they were written to
everybody they do not look as if they had been written to
anybody.' Pope said once, what he did not mean, that he
could not write agreeable letters. This was true; his letters
are, as Charles Fox said, 'very bad,' but some of Pope's
friends write admirably, and if there is much that can be
skipped without loss in the correspondence, there is much
which no student of the period can afford to neglect.
'There has accumulated,' says Mark Pattison, 'round Pope's
poems a mass of biographical anecdote such as surrounds
the writings of no other English author,' and not a little
knowledge of this kind is to be gleaned from his correspondence.</p>

<p>In the years spent at Twickenham Pope produced his
most characteristic work. It is as a satirist that he,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
with one exception, excels all English poets, and Pope's
careful workmanship often makes his satirical touches
more attractive than Dryden's.</p>

<p>'To attack vices in the abstract,' he said to Arbuthnot,
'without touching persons, may be safe fighting indeed,
but it is fighting with shadows;' and Pope, under the
plea of a detestation of vice, generally betrayed his contempt
or hatred of the men whom he assailed. No doubt
the critics and Grub Street hacks of the day gave him
provocation. Pope, however, was frequently the first to
take the field, and so eager was he to meet his foes that
it would seem as if he enjoyed the conflict. Yet there
were times when he felt acutely the assaults made upon
him. 'These things are my diversion,' he once said, with
a ghastly smile, and it was observed that he writhed in
agony like a man undergoing an operation. The attacks
made with these paper bullets, not only on the side of
Grub Street but on his own, show very vividly the coarseness
of London society. Courtesy was disregarded by
men who claimed to be wits and scholars. Pope held,
perhaps, a higher place in literature in his own day than
Lord Tennyson has held in ours, for the best beloved
of Laureates had noble rivals and friends who came
near to him in fame, while Pope, until the publication
of Thomson's <i>Seasons</i>, in 1730, stood alone in poetical
reputation. Yet he was reviled in the language of Billingsgate,
and had no scruple in using that language himself.
Late in life Pope collected the libels made upon him and
bound them in four volumes, but he omitted to mention
the provocation which gave rise to many of them. Eusden,
Colley Cibber, Dennis, Theobald, Blackmore, Smyth, and
Lord Hervey are among the prominent criminals placed in
Pope's pillory, and the student of the age may find an idle
entertainment in tracking the poet's thorny course, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
he gives an unenviable notoriety to names of which the
larger number were 'born to be forgot.'</p>

<p>In 1725 Swift had written to Pope advising him not to
immortalize the names of bad poets by putting them in his
verse, and Pope replied to this advice by saying, 'I am
much the happier for finding (a better thing than our
wits) our judgments jump in the notion that all scribblers
should be passed by in silence.' How entirely his inclination
got the better of his judgment was seen three years
later in the <i>Dunciad</i>. The first three books of this famous
satire were published in 1728. It is generally regarded as
Pope's masterpiece, but the accuracy of such an estimate is
doubtful. So heavily weighted is the poem with notes,
prefaces, and introductions that the text appears to be
smothered by them. It was Pope's aim to mystify his
readers, and in this he has succeeded, for the mystifications
of the poem even confound the commentators. The personalities
of the satire excited a keen interest, and much
amusement to readers who were not included in Pope's
black list of dunces. At the same time it roused a number
of authors to fury, as it well might. His satire is often unjust,
and he includes among the dunces men wholly undeserving
of the name, who had had the misfortune to offend
him. To place a great scholar like Bentley, an eloquent and
earnest preacher like Whitefield, and a man of genius like
Defoe among the dunces was to stultify himself, and if
Pope in his spite against Theobald found some justification
for giving the commentator pre-eminence for dulness in
three books of the <i>Dunciad</i>, his anger got the better of his
wit when in Book IV. he dethroned Theobald to exalt
Colley Cibber. For Cibber, with a thousand faults, so far
from being dull had a buoyancy of heart and a sprightliness
of intellect wholly out of harmony with the character
he is made to assume.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>That he might have some excuse for his dashing assaults
in the <i>Dunciad</i>, Pope had published in the third volume of
the <i>Miscellanies</i>, of which he and Swift, Arbuthnot and Gay
were the joint authors, an <i>Essay on Bathos</i> in which several
writers of the day were sneered at. The assault provoked the
counter-attack for which Pope was looking, and he then produced
the satire which was already prepared for the press.
In its publication the poet, as usual, made use of trickery
and deception. At first he issued an imperfect edition with
initial letters instead of names, but on seeing his way to
act more openly, the poem appeared in a large edition with
names and notes.</p>

<p>'In order to lessen the danger of prosecution for libel,'
Mr. Courthope writes, 'he prevailed on three peers, with
whom he was on the most intimate terms, the good-natured
Lord Bathurst, the easy-going Earl of Oxford, and the
magnificent Earl of Burlington, to act as his nominal publishers;
and it was through them that copies of the
enlarged edition were at first distributed, the booksellers
not being allowed to sell any in their shops. The King and
Queen were each presented with a copy by the hands of
Sir R. Walpole. In this manner, as the report quickly
spread that the poem was the property of rich and powerful
noblemen, there was a natural disinclination on the part
of the dunces to take legal proceedings, and the prestige
of the <i>Dunciad</i> being thus fairly established, the booksellers
were allowed to proceed with the sale in regular
course.'<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Dunciad</i> owes its merit to the literary felicities
with which its pages abound. The theme is a mean one.
Pope, from his social eminence at Twickenham, looks with
scorn on the authors who write for bread, and with malig<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>nity
on the authors whom he regarded as his enemies.
There is, for the most part, little elevation in his method
of treatment, and we can almost fancy that we see a cruel
joy in the poet's face as he impales the victims of his
wrath. Some portions of the <i>Dunciad</i> are tainted with the
imagery which, to quote the strong phrase of Mr. Churton
Collins, often makes Swift as offensive as a polecat,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and
there is no part of it which can be read with unmixed
pleasure, if we except the noble lines which conclude the
satire. Those lines may be almost said to redeem the
faults of the poem, and they prove incontestably, if such
proof be needed, Pope's claim to a place among the poets.</p>

<p>The publication of the <i>Dunciad</i> showed Pope where his
main strength as a poet lay. That the writers he had
attacked, in many instances without provocation, should
resent the ungrateful notoriety conferred upon them was
inevitable. In self-defence, and to add to the provocation
already given, he started a paper called the <i>Grub Street
Journal</i>, which existed for eight years&mdash;Pope, who had no
scruple in 'hazarding a lie,' denying all the time that he
had any connection with it.</p>

<p>His next work of significance, <i>The Essay on Man</i>, a professedly
philosophical poem by an author who knew little
of philosophy, was published in four epistles, in 1733-4.
Bolingbroke's brilliant, versatile, and shallow intellect had
strongly impressed Swift, and had also fascinated Pope.
It has been commonly supposed that the <i>Essay</i> owes its
existence to his suggestion and guidance. The poet believed
in his philosophy, and had the loftiest estimate of
his genius. In the last and perhaps finest passage of the
poem he calls Bolingbroke the 'master of the poet and the
song,' and draws a picture of the ambitious statesman as
beautiful as it is false. In Mark Pattison's Introduction
to <i>The Essay on Man</i>,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> which every student of Pope
will read, he objects to the notion that the poet took the
scheme of his work from Bolingbroke, observing that both
derived their views from a common source.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<p>'Everywhere, in the pulpit, in the coffee-houses, in every
pamphlet, argument on the origin of evil, on the goodness
of God, and the constitution of the world was rife. Into
the prevailing topic of polite conversation Bolingbroke,
who returned from exile in 1723, was drawn by the bent
of his native genius. Pope followed the example and
impulse of his friend's more powerful mind. Thus much
there was of special suggestion. But the arguments or
topics of the poem are to be traced to books in much
vogue at the time; to Shaftesbury's <i>Characteristics</i> (1711),
King on the <i>Origin of Evil</i> (1702), and particularly to
Leibnitz, <i>Essais de Théodicée</i> (1710).'</p>

<p>In admitting that Pope followed the impulse of a more
powerful mind, Mr. Pattison asserts as much perhaps as
can be known with certainty as to Bolingbroke's influence,
but it is reasonable to believe that the close intercourse of
the two men did immensely sway the more impressionable,
and, so far as philosophy is concerned, the more ignorant of
the two. Mr. Pattison also overlooks the fact that Pope
confessed to Warburton that he had never read a line of
Leibnitz in his life. That the poet acknowledges his large
debt to Bolingbroke, and that Bolingbroke confesses it was
due, is all that can be declared with certainty. That which
makes the <i>Essay</i> worthy the reading is the fruit, not of the
argument but of the poetry, and for that Pope trusted to
his own genius.</p>

<p>His attempt to 'vindicate the ways of God to man'
is confused and contradictory, and no modern reader,
perplexed with the mystery of existence, is likely to gain
aid from Pope. Nominally a Roman Catholic, and in
reality a deist, apart from poetry he does not seem to have
had strong convictions on any subject, and was content to
be swayed by the opinions current in society. In undertaking
to write an ethical work like the <i>Essay</i> his ambition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
was greater than his strength, yet if Pope's philosophy
does not 'find' us, to use Coleridge's phrase, it did
appeal to a large number of minds in his own day, and
had not lost its popularity at a later period. The poem
has been frequently translated into French, into Italian,
and into German; it was pronounced by Voltaire to be the
most useful and sublime didactic poem ever written in any
language; it was admired by Kant and quoted in his
lectures; and it received high praise from the Scotch
philosopher, Dugald Stewart. The charm of poetical expression
is lost or nearly lost in translations, and while the
sense may be retained the aroma of the verse is gone. The
popularity of the <i>Essay</i> abroad is therefore not easily to
be accounted for, unless we accept the theory that the
shallow creed on which it is based suited an age less
earnest than our own.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Pope has no strong convictions in this poem, but he has
many moods. On one page he is a pantheist, on another
he says what he probably did not mean, that God inspires
men to do evil, and on a third that 'all our knowledge
is ourselves to know.' Nowhere in the argument does
Pope seem to have a firm standing, and De Quincey is
not far wrong in saying that it is 'the realization of
anarchy.'</p>

<p>Read the poem for its poetical merits and you will forget
its defects. Pope was a superficial teacher, but direct teaching
is not the end of poetry. <i>The Essay on Man</i> is not a poem
which can be read and re-read with ever-growing delight,
but there are passages in it of as fine an order as any that
he has composed on more familiar subjects. Pope was, as
Sir William Hamilton said, a curious reader, and the ideas
versified in the poem may be traced to a variety of sources.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Students who wish to follow this track will find all the help
they need in Mr. Pattison's instructive notes, and in the
comments attached to the poem in Elwin and Courthope's
edition. In his Introduction Mr. Pattison observes that
'the subject of the <i>Essay on Man</i> is not, considered in itself,
one unfit for poetry. Had Pope had a genius for philosophy
there was no reason why he should not have selected
a philosophical subject. Didactic poetry is a mistake if not
a contradiction in terms. But poetry is not necessarily
didactic because its subject is philosophical.'</p>

<p>It is always difficult to define the themes suitable for
poetry. Many theories have been formed as to the scope
of the art, and poets have been amply instructed by critics as
to what they ought to do, and what they should avoid doing.
The theories may appear sound, the arguments convincing,
until a great poet arises and knocks them on the head. In a
sense every poet of the highest order is also a philosopher
and a prophet who sees into 'the life of things.' Whether
a philosophical subject can be fitly represented in the imaginative
light of poetry is a matter for discussion rather than
for decision. In the case of Pope, however, it will be
evident to all studious readers that he was incapable of the
continuous thought needed for the argument of the <i>Essay</i>.</p>

<p>'Anything like sustained reasoning,' says Mr. Leslie
Stephen,' was beyond his reach. Pope felt and thought
by shocks and electric flashes.... The defect was aggravated
or caused by the physical infirmities which put
sustained intellectual labour out of the question.'<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Crousaz, a Swiss pastor and professor, who appears to
have competed with Berkeley for a prize and won it,
attacked Pope's <i>Essay</i> for its want of orthodoxy, and his
work was translated into English. The poet became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
alarmed, but had the good fortune to find a champion in
Warburton, who for the rest of his life did Pope much
service, not always of a reputable kind. We shall have
more to say of him later on, and it will suffice to observe
here that Warburton, who through Pope's friendship
obtained a good wife, a fortune, and a bishopric, was not a
man of high character. His sole object was to advance in
life, and he succeeded.</p>

<p>The <i>Moral Essays</i> as they are called, and the <i>Imitations
from Horace</i> are the final and crowning efforts of the
poet's genius. They contain his finest workmanship as a
satirist, and will be read, I think, with more pleasure than
the <i>Dunciad</i>, despite Mr. Ruskin's judgment of that poem
as 'the most absolutely chiselled and monumental work
"exacted" in our country.'<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> It is impossible to concur in
this estimate. The imagery of the poem serves only to
disgust, and the spiteful attacks made in it on forgotten
men want the largeness of purpose that lifts satire above
what is of temporary interest, making it a lesson for all
time.</p>

<p>Pope's venom, and the personal animosities which give
the sharpest sting, and in some instances a zest, to his
verse, are also amply displayed in the <i>Moral Essays</i> and in
the <i>Imitations</i>, but the scope is wider in these poems, and
the subjects allow of more versatile treatment. They should
be read with the help of notes, a help generally needed for
satirical poetry, but it should be remembered always that
editorial judgments are to be received with discretion and
not servilely followed. There is perhaps no danger more
carefully to be shunned by the student of literature than
the habit of resting satisfied with opinions at second-hand.
Better a wrong estimate formed after due reading and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
thought, than a right estimate gleaned from critics, without
any thought at all.</p>

<p>According to Warburton, who is as tricky as Pope himself
when it suits his purpose to be so, the <i>Essay on Man</i>
was intended to form four books, in which, as part of the
general design, the <i>Moral Essays</i> would have been included,
as well as Book IV. of the <i>Dunciad</i>, but to have welded
these <i>Essays</i>, which were published separately, into one
continuous poem would neither have suited Pope's genius
nor the character of the poems; and how the last book of
the <i>Dunciad</i> could have been included in such an <i>olla
podrida</i> it is difficult to conceive. The poet was fond of projects,
and this, happily for his readers, remained one. The
dates of the four <i>Essays</i>, which are really Epistles, and
appeared in folio pamphlets, run over several years, but
were afterwards re-arranged by Pope. That to Lord Burlington,
<i>Of the Use of Riches</i> (Epistle IV.), was published
in 1731, under the title, <i>Of False Taste</i>; that to Lord
Bathurst, <i>Of the Use of Riches</i> (Epistle III), in 1732; the
epistle to Lord Cobham (Epistle I.), <i>Of the Knowledge and
Characters of Men</i>, bears the date of 1733; and that To a
Lady (Epistle II.), <i>Of the Characters of Women</i>, in 1735.
Pope wrote other Epistles, some at a much earlier period
of his career, which follow the <i>Moral Essays</i> but are not
connected with them. Of these one is addressed to Addison,
two are to Martha Blount, for whom the second of the <i>Moral
Essays</i> was written; one to the painter Jervas, originally
printed in 1717; while another, a few lines only in
length, was addressed to Craggs when Secretary of State.
Space will not allow of examining each of the <i>Essays</i>
minutely, but there are portions of them which call for
comment.</p>

<p>The first <i>Moral Essay</i>, <i>Of the Knowledge and Characters
of Men</i>, in which Pope enlarges on his theory of a ruling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
passion, affords a significant example of his incapacity for
sustaining an argument, since Warburton, to use his own
words, entirely changed and reversed the order and disposition
of the several parts to make the composition more
coherent. That he has succeeded is doubtful, that he
should have ventured upon such a task shows where Pope's
weakness lay as a philosophical poet. It is the least interesting
of the <i>Essays</i>, but is not without lines that none
but Pope could have written. <i>The Characters of Women</i>,
the subject of the second <i>Essay</i>, was not one which the
satirist could treat with justice. He saw little in the sex
save their foibles, and the lines with which it opens show
the spirit that animates the poem:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Nothing so true as what you once let fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Most women have no character at all,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Matter too soft a lasting mark to bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And best distinguished by black, brown, or fair.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The satire contains one of Pope's offensive allusions to
Lady Mary, and the celebrated portrait drawn from two
notable women, the Duchess of Buckingham and Sarah,
Duchess of Marlborough, from the latter of whom the
poet, at one time, despite his unquestionable love of
independence, received £1,000. The story, like many
another in the career of Pope, is wrapt in mystery.</p>

<p>Pope took great pains with the Epistle <i>Of the Use of
Riches</i>. It was altered from the original conception by the
advice of Warburton, who cared more for the argument of
a poem than for its poetry. The thought and purpose of
the <i>Essay</i> are defective, notwithstanding Warburton's effort
to clear them, but these defects are of slight moment when
compared with the brilliant passages with which the poem
is studded. Among them is the famous description of the
Duke of Buckingham's death-bed which should be com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>pared
with Dryden's equally famous lines on the same
nobleman's character.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'In the worst inn's worst room, with mat half-hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The floors of plaster, and the walls of dung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On once a flock-heel, but repaired with straw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tape-tied curtains never meant to draw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The George and Garter dangling from that bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where tawdry yellow strove with dirty red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great Villiers lies&mdash;alas! how changed from him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That life of pleasure, and that soul of whim!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gallant and gay, in Cliveden's proud alcove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bower of wanton Shrewsbury and love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or just as gay at council, in a ring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mimic statesmen and their merry King.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No wit to flatter left of all his store!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No fool to laugh at, which he valued more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, victor of his health, of fortune, friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fame, this lord of useless thousands ends.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is also a covert attack in this Epistle upon the
moneyed interest represented by Walpole, and on the
political corruption which he sanctioned and promoted.
Yet Pope knew how to praise the great Whig statesman
for his social qualities:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Seen him I have, but in his happier hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of social pleasure, ill exchanged for power;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seen him uncumbered with the venal tribe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smile without art and win without a bribe.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Epistle IV. pursues the same subject as the third, and
deals mainly with false taste in the expenditure of wealth,
and with the necessity of following 'sense, of every art the
soul.' In this poem there is the far-famed description of
Timon's Villa, and by Timon Pope was accused of representing
the Duke of Chandos, whose estate at Canons he is
supposed to have held in scorn after having been, as he
acknowledges, 'distinguished' by its master. That would
not have deterred Pope from producing a brilliant picture,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
and his equivocations did but serve to increase suspicion.
Probably he found it convenient to use some features of
what he may have seen at Canons while composing a
general sketch with no special application. The <i>Moral
Essays</i>, it may be added, are not especially moral, but they
are full of fine things, and form a portion of Pope's verse
second only to the <i>Imitations from Horace</i>.</p>

<p>These <i>Imitations</i> are introduced by the Prologue addressed
to Dr. Arbuthnot, a poem of more than common
brilliancy, and also more than commonly venomous. Nowhere,
perhaps, is there in Pope's works so powerful and
bitter an attack as the twenty-five lines in the Prologue
devoted to the vivisection of Lord Hervey, which we are
forced to admire while feeling their malevolence; nowhere
is there a more consummate piece of satire than the twenty-two
lines that contain the poet's masterpiece, the character
of Atticus; and nowhere, I may add, are there lines more
personally interesting. Portions of the poem were written
long before the date of publication, and this is Pope's
excuse, a rather lame one perhaps, for printing the character
of Atticus and the lines on his mother after the death of
Addison and of Mrs. Pope.</p>

<p>'When I had a fever one winter in town,' Pope said to
his friend Spence, 'that confined me to my room for
some days, Lord Bolingbroke came to see me, happened
to take up a Horace that lay on the table, and in turning
it over dipt on the first satire of the second book. He
observed how well that would hit my case if I were
to imitate it in English. After he was gone I read it
over, translated it in a morning or two, and sent it to
press in a week or fortnight after. And this was the
occasion of my imitating some other of the satires and
epistles afterwards.'</p>

<p>Bolingbroke did his friend a better service in giving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
this advice than he had done with regard to the <i>Essay on
Man</i>; and the six <i>Imitations</i>, with the Prologue and
Epilogue, which are among the latest fruits of Pope's genius
as a satirist, are also the ripest.</p>

<p>Warburton, writing of the <i>Imitations of Horace</i>, says:
'Whoever expects a paraphrase of Horace or a faithful copy
of his genius or his manner of writing in these <i>Imitations</i>
will be much disappointed. Our author uses the Roman poet
for little more than his canvas; and if the old design or
colouring chance to suit his purpose, it is well; if not, he
employs his own without scruple or ceremony.'</p>

<p>This is true. Pope makes use of Horace when it suits
his convenience, but never follows him servilely, and quits
him altogether when his design carries him another way.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that he should exercise this freedom,
since, as Johnson has pointed out, there will always be an
irreconcilable dissimilitude between Roman images and
English manners. Moreover, the aim of the two poets was
different, Pope's main object being to express personal
enmities and to give an exalted notion of his own virtue.</p>

<p>In the opening lines of his First Satire Pope follows
Horace pretty closely. Both poets complain that some
persons think them too severe, and others too complaisant;
both take the advice of a lawyer, Horace of C. Trebatius
Testa, who gives him the pithiest replies; and Pope of
Fortescue. Both complain that they cannot sleep, the
prescription of a wife and cowslip wine being given by the
English adviser, while Testa advises Horace to swim thrice
across the Tiber and moisten his lips with wine. Throughout
the rest of the satire Pope takes only casual glances at
the Roman original, and if in the Second Satire the English
poet follows Horace in the first few verses in recommending
frugality, and in the advice to keep the middle state, and
neither to lean on this side or on that, the resemblance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
between the poets is seldom striking, and the spirit which
animates them is different,&mdash;Horace being classical, and
therefore open to the apprehension of all educated readers,
while Pope is in a sense provincial, and, as I have already
said with reference to the <i>Dunciad</i>, cannot be fully enjoyed
or even understood without some knowledge of the time
and of the men whom he lashes in his satire. The Sixth
Epistle of the First Book of Horace, which Pope attempts
to imitate, is, as Mr. Courthope observes, 'incapable of
imitation. Its humour, no less than its philosophy, belongs
entirely to the Pagan World.' In a general sense it is
also true that Horace's style, whether of language or of
thought, will not bear transplanting. Indeed, whatever is
most characteristic and most exquisite in a poet's work is
precisely the portion which cannot be clothed in a foreign
dress.</p>

<p>'Life,' said Pope, 'when the first heats are over is all
down hill,' and with him the downward progress began at
a time when most men are still standing on the summit.
Never was there a more fiery spirit in so weak a body. He
suffered frequently from headaches, which he relieved by
inhaling the steam of coffee. Unfortunately he pampered
his appetite and paid a heavy penalty for doing so.
Every change of weather affected him; and at the time
when most people indulge in company, he tells Swift that
he hid himself in bed. Although he sneers at Lord Hervey
for taking asses' milk he tried that remedy himself, and he
frequently needed medical aid. In his early days he was
strong enough to ride on horseback, but in later life his
weakness was so great that he was in constant need of help.
M. Taine, whose criticism of Pope needs to be read with
caution, indulges in an exaggerated description of his
bodily condition, observing that when arrived at maturity
he appeared no longer capable of existing, and styling him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
'a nervous abortion.' The poet's condition was sad enough
as told by Dr. Johnson, without amplifying it as M. Taine
has done. 'One side was contracted. His legs were so slender
that he enlarged their bulk with three pairs of stockings,
which were drawn on and off by the maid; for he was not
able to dress or undress himself, and neither went to bed nor
rose without help. His weakness made it very difficult for
him to be clean.' After this forlorn description of the poet's
state it is a little grotesque to read that his dress of ceremony
was black, with a tie-wig and a little sword. A distorted
body often holds a generous and untainted soul.
This was not the case with Pope, and the sympathy he stood
in so large a need of himself, was seldom given to others.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1744 it became evident that the end was
approaching. Three weeks before his death he distributed
the <i>Moral Epistles</i> among his friends, saying: 'Here I am,
like Socrates, dispensing my morality amongst my friends
just as I am dying.' He died peacefully on May 30th,
1744, and was buried in Twickenham Church near the
monument erected to his parents.</p>

<p>Pope's standing among his country's poets has been the
source of much controversy. There have been critics who
deny to him the name of a poet, while others place him in the
first rank. In his own century there was comparatively little
difference of opinion with regard to his merits. Chesterfield
gave him the warmest praise; Swift, Addison, and Warburton
ranked him with the peers of song; Johnson, whose
discriminative criticism reaches perhaps its highest level in
his <i>Life of Pope</i>, in reply to the question which had been
asked, even in his day, whether Pope was a poet? asks in
return, 'If Pope be not a poet, where is poetry to be
found?' and adds that 'to circumscribe poetry by a definition
will only show the narrowness of the definer, though
a definition which shall exclude Pope will not readily be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
made.' Joseph Warton, too, Johnson's contemporary and
friend, while preferring the Romantic School to the Classical,
allows that in that species of poetry wherein Pope
excelled he is superior to all mankind.</p>

<p>In our century Bowles, whose edition of his works provoked
prolonged discussion, in which Campbell, Byron, and
the <i>Quarterly Review</i> took part, places Pope above Dryden.
Byron, with more enthusiasm than judgment, regarded
him as the greatest name in our poetry; Scott, with generous
appreciation of a genius so alien to his own, called
him a 'true Deacon of the craft,' and at one time proposed
editing his works, a task projected also by Mr. Ruskin,
who, putting Shakespeare aside as rather the world's than
ours, holds Pope 'to be the most perfect representative we
have since Chaucer of the true English mind.' 'Matched
on his own ground,' says Mr. Swinburne, 'he never has
been nor can be.' And Mr. Lowell in the same strain
observes that 'in his own province he still stands unapproachably
alone.'</p>

<p>What then is Pope's ground? What is this province of
which he is the sole ruler? To a considerable extent the
question has been answered in these pages, but it may be
well to sum up with more definiteness what has been
already stated.</p>

<p>In poetry Pope takes a first place in the second order of
poets. The deficiencies which forbid his entrance into the
first rank are obvious. He cannot sing, he has no ear for
the subtlest melodies of verse, he is not a creative poet,
and has few of the spirit-stirring thoughts which the noblest
poets scatter through their pages with apparent unconsciousness.
There are no depths in Pope and there are no
heights; he has neither eye for the beauties of Nature, nor
ear for her harmonies, and a primrose was no more to him
than it was to Peter Bell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>These are defects indeed, but nothing is more unfair says
a great French critic than to judge notable minds solely by
their defects, and in spite of them Pope's position is so
unassailable that the critic must take a contracted view of
the poet's art who questions his right to the title.</p>

<p>His merits are of a kind not likely to be affected by
time; a lively fancy, a power of satire almost unrivalled, and
a skill in using words so consummate that there is no poet,
excepting Shakespeare, who has left his mark upon the
language so strongly. The loss to us if Pope's verse were
to become extinct cannot readily be measured. He has
said in the best words what we all know and feel, but
cannot express, and has made that classical which in
weaker hands would be commonplace. His sensibility to
the claims of his art is exquisite, the adaptation of his
style to his subject shows the hand of a master, and if
these are not the highest gifts of a poet, they are gifts to
which none but a poet can lay claim.</p>

<h3>PRIOR, GAY, YOUNG, BLAIR, THOMSON.</h3>


<div class="sidenote">Matthew Prior
(1664-1721).</div>

<p>The ease with which the Queen Anne wits obtained office
and rose to posts of high trust through the
pleasant art of verse-making, is conspicuous
in the career of Prior. His parents are unknown,
the place of his birth is somewhat doubtful, although
he is claimed by Wimborne-Minster, in Dorsetshire, and
the first trustworthy facts recorded of his early career are
that he was a Westminster scholar when the famous Dr.
Busby, whose discipline was physical as well as mental,
presided over the school. His father died, and his mother
being no longer able to pay the school fees, Prior was
placed with an uncle who kept the Rhenish Wine Tavern
in Westminster. His seat was in the bar, and there the
Earl of Dorset (1637-1705-6), a small poet, but a generous
patron of poets, found the youth reading Horace, and,
pleased with his 'parts,' sent him back to Westminster,
whence he went up to Cambridge as a scholar at St. John's,
the college destined a century later to receive one of the
greatest of English poets.</p>

<p>Charles Montague, afterwards Earl of Halifax (1661-1715),
the son of a younger son of a nobleman, was also
a Westminster scholar. He entered Trinity College in
1679, and like Prior appears to have owed his good
fortune to the rhymer's craft. 'At thirty,' writes Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Macaulay, 'he would gladly have given all his chances in
life for a comfortable vicarage and a chaplain's scarf. At
thirty-seven he was First Lord of the Treasury, Chancellor
of the Exchequer, and a Regent of the Kingdom.' The
literary history of the Queen Anne age has many associations
with his name. He proved a liberal patron of the wits, and
of Pope among them, by subscribing largely to his <i>Homer</i>;
but the poet's memory was stronger for imaginary injuries
than for real benefits, and because Halifax had patronized
Tickell, he figures in the Prologue to the Satires as 'full-blown
Bufo, puffed by every quill.'</p>

<p>Prior and Montague began their rhyming career early,
and a partnership production, entitled the <i>Hind and Panther,
transversed to the story of the Country Mouse and the City
Mouse</i> (1687), a parody of Dryden's famous poem published
in the same year, brought both authors into notice. At the
age of twenty-six Prior, who had previously obtained a fellowship,
was appointed Secretary to the Embassy at the Hague.
After that he rose steadily to eminence, became Secretary of
State in Ireland, and was finally appointed Ambassador at
the French Court. High office brings its troubles, and in
those days was not without its perils. In 1711 Prior was
sent secretly to Paris to negotiate a peace, for which, when
the Whigs came again into power, he was imprisoned and
expected to lose his head. While in prison, where he remained
for two years (1715-1717), the poet wrote <i>Alma</i>, a
humorous and speculative poem on the relations of the soul
and body, and when released published his <i>Poems</i> by subscription
in a noble folio, said to be the largest-sized volume
in the whole range of English poetry. He gained 4,000
guineas by the publication, and with that sum and an
estate purchased for him by Lord Harley, Prior was able
to live in comfort. He died in September, 1721, in his
fifty-eighth year, and was buried in Westminster Abbey,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
under a monument for which he had had the vanity to pay
five hundred pounds.</p>

<p>The peculiar merit of Prior is better understood in our
day than it was in his own. We read his poems solely for
the sake of the 'lighter pieces,' which Johnson despised.
The poet thought <i>Solomon</i> his best work, but no one who
toils through the three books which form that poem is likely
to agree with this estimate. Dulness pervades the work
like an atmosphere, but it had its admirers in the last century,
and among them was John Wesley, who, in reply to
Johnson's complaint of its tediousness, said he should as
soon think of calling the Second or Sixth Æneid tedious.
In the preface to the poem Prior declares that he "had
rather be thought a good Englishman than the best poet
or greatest scholar that ever wrote," a passage which does
more honour to the poet than any in the text. A far
more popular piece was <i>Henry and Emma</i>, which even
so fine a judge of poetry as Cowper called 'inimitable.'
Tastes change, let us hope for the better, and possibly none
but the greatest poets remain unaffected by time. Assuredly
Prior does not, and <i>Henry and Emma</i> affords a
striking illustration of the contrast between the poetical
spirit of Prior's age and that which influences ours. The
poem is founded on the fine ballad of the <i>Nut-Browne
Maide</i>. The story, as originally told, is homely and
quaint, written without apparent effort and told in 360
lines. Prior requires considerably more than twice that
number, and his maid and her lover, instead of using the
simple language befitting the theme, employ the conventional
machinery of the age, and bring Jove and Mars,
Cupid and Venus upon the scene, with allusions to Marlborough's
victories and to 'Anna's wondrous reign.'</p>

<p><i>Alma</i>, a poem written in Hudibrastic verse, which shows
that Prior had in a measure caught the vein of Butler, has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
some couplets familiar in quotations. He won, too, not a
little contemporary reputation for his tales in verse, which
are singularly coarse; but an age that tolerated Mrs. Manley
and read the plays and novels of Aphra Behn was not likely
to object to the grossness of Prior. Dr. Johnson would not
admit that his poems were unfit for a lady's table, and
Wesley, who appears to have been strangely oblivious to
Prior's moral delinquencies, observes that his tales are the
best told of any in the English tongue. Cowper praised
him for his 'charming ease,' and this gift enabled him to
write some of the most delightful occasional verses produced
in the century. There is nothing more exquisite of
its kind than his address, <i>To a Child of Quality</i>, written
when the child was five years old and the poet forty, and
one is not surprised to learn that Prior was admired by
Thomas Moore, who more than once caught his note. A
reader familiar with Moore and ignorant of Prior would
without hesitation attribute the following stanzas, from
the <i>Answer to Chloe Jealous</i>, to the Irish poet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The god of us versemen (you know, Child), the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How after his journeys he sets up his rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If at morning o'er earth 'tis his fancy to run,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At night he declines on his Thetis's breast.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'So when I am wearied with wandering all day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To thee, my delight, in the evening I come;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No matter what beauties I saw in my way;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They were but my visits, but thou art my home.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Then finish, dear Cloe, this pastoral war,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And let us, like Horace and Lydia, agree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thou art a girl as much brighter than her<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As he was a poet sublimer than me.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The grammatical lapse in these last two lines," says Mr.
Austin Dobson, "perhaps calls for correction, but many
readers will probably agree with Moore (<i>Diary</i>, November,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
1818), 'that it is far prettier as it is.' 'Nothing,' he says
truly, 'can be more gracefully light and gallant than this
little poem.'"</p>

<p>It was fancy and not imagination which conceived the
following lines, but how charming is the fancy! The
poem, which is given in a slightly abridged form, is
addressed</p>

<p class="center">'<span class="smcap">To a Lady: she refusing to continue a dispute with me,
and leaving me in the argument.</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'In the dispute whate'er I said,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My heart was by my tongue belied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in my looks you might have read<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How much I argued on your side.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'You, far from danger as from fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Might have sustained an open fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For seldom your opinions err;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Your eyes are always in the right.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Alas! not hoping to subdue,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I only to the fight aspired;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep the beauteous foe in view<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was all the glory I desired.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'But she, howe'er of victory sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Contemns the wreath too long delayed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, armed with more immediate power,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Calls cruel silence to her aid.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Deeper to wound, she shuns the fight:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She drops her arms, to gain the field;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secures her conquest by her flight;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And triumphs, when she seems to yield.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'So when the Parthian turned his steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And from the hostile camp withdrew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cruel skill the backward reed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He sent; and as he fled, he slew.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Wit and a ready command of verse are the characteristics
of Prior's poetry. Both of these gifts are to be seen in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
lively <i>English ballad on the Taking of Namur by the King
of Great Britain</i>, in which he travesties Boileau's <i>Ode sur
la prise de Namur</i>. As an epigrammatist he reaped his
advantage from a study of Martial, and in this department
of verse Prior is often successful. If brevity be a prominent
merit in an epigram, he sometimes excels his
master, as, for example, in this stanza:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'To John I owed great obligation;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But John unhappily thought fit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To publish it to all the nation;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sure John and I are more than quit.'<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is half the length of the original Latin, and what it
loses in elegance it gains in point.</p>

<p>It may be hoped that the next quotation is a libel on
Bishop Atterbury; if so, the lines have every merit but
truth. The epigram is on the funeral of the Duke of
Buckingham, who died in 1721.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I have no hopes,' the duke he says, and dies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'In sure and certain hopes,' the prelate cries:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of these two learned peers, I prithee say, man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is the lying knave, the priest or layman?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The duke he stands an infidel confest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'He's our dear brother,' quoth the lordly priest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The duke, though knave, still 'brother dear,' he cries;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who can say the reverend prelate lies?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Prior, it may be observed here, could say pointed things
in prose as well as in verse, and nothing can be happier
than his reply to the Frenchman's inquiry whether the
King of England had anything to show in his palace equal
to the paintings at Versailles illustrating the victories of
Louis XIV: 'The monuments of my master's actions,' said
the poet, 'are to be seen everywhere except in his own house.'</p>

<p>It is always interesting to link poet with poet, and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
relation to Prior many readers will recall the pathetic
incident related of Sir Walter Scott when the wonderful
intellect which had entranced the world was giving indications
of decay. Lockhart relates how, as they were travelling
together, a quotation from Prior led Scott to make
another, slightly altered for the occasion, and he adds:</p>

<p>'This seemed to put him into the train of Prior, and he
repeated several striking passages both of the <i>Alma</i> and
the <i>Solomon</i>. He was still at this when we reached a
longish hill, and he got out to walk a little. As we climbed
the ascent, he leaning heavily on my shoulder, we were met
by a couple of beggars, who were, or professed to be, old
soldiers both of Egypt and the Peninsula. One of them
wanted a leg, which circumstance alone would have opened
Scott's purse-strings, though, <i>ex facie</i>, a sad old blackguard;
but the fellow had recognized his person as it happened,
and in asking an alms bade God bless him fervently by his
name. The mendicants went on their way, and we stood
breathing on the knoll. Sir Walter followed them with his
eye, and planting his stick firmly on the sod, repeated, without
break or hesitation Prior's verses to the historian
Mezeray. That he applied them to himself was touchingly
obvious, and therefore I must quote them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John Gay
(1685-1732).</div>

<p>Gay, who enjoyed an unbroken friendship with the
brotherhood of wits, and was treated by
them like a spoilt child, was born at Barnstaple
in 1685, and left an orphan at the age
of ten. He was educated at the free grammar school in
the town, and was afterwards, to his discontent, apprenticed
to a mercer in London. He escaped from this uncongenial
employment to be dependent on an uncle, and thus
early exhibited his life-long disposition to rely upon others
for support. 'Providence,' Swift writes, 'never designed
Gay to be above two-and-twenty by his thoughtlessness and
gullibility. He has as little foresight of age, sickness,
poverty, or loss of admirers as a girl of fifteen.' His weakness,
it has been said, appealed to Swift's strength, and
Swift, Pope, and Arbuthnot were Gay's most faithful
friends. They found something in him to laugh at and to
love. Ladies, too, treated him with the kind of friendliness
which has a touch of commiseration. In 1714 Gay
was appointed secretary to Lord Clarendon, a post which
he owed to Swift, but the death of Queen Anne in that
year brought the Whigs into office, and destroyed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
poet's prospects. Prior to this he had been secretary to
the imperious Duchess of Monmouth. He was now left
without money or employment, and owed much to the
generosity of Pope. It was Gay's lot 'in suing long to
bide,' to be always hoping, and nearly always disappointed.
'He seems,' says his latest biographer, 'to have begun his
career under the impression that it was somebody's duty to
provide for him in the world, and this impression clung to
him through nearly the whole of a lifetime.'<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Ten years
before his death he was eagerly looking to others for support.
Writing to Swift, he says: 'I lodge at present in
Burlington House, and have received many civilities from
many great men, but very few real benefits. They wonder
at each other for not providing for me, and I wonder at
them all.'</p>

<p>Gay's first poem of any mark was <i>The Shepherd's Week</i>
(1714), six burlesque pastorals, a subject proposed to him
by Pope, who was then smarting from the praise Philips
had received in <i>The Guardian</i>. But if Pope meant Gay to
poke his fun at Philips in <i>The Shepherd's Week</i>, he must
have been disappointed, for the poems were accepted as
genuine bucolics, and although humorously absurd, are,
to say the least, more true to rustic life than the pastorals
either of Philips or of Pope. <i>The Shepherd's Week</i> was
followed by <i>Trivia</i> (1715), a piece suggested by Swift's
<i>City Shower</i>. It is one of Gay's most notable productions,
not as a poem, but as a vivid description of the streets
of London nearly two hundred years ago. The great reputation
he obtained as the author of <i>The Fables</i> (1727),
and still more of <i>The Beggar's Opera</i> (1728), the idea of
which was suggested to Gay by Swift, survived him for
some years. <i>The Fables</i> were written for and dedicated to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the youthful Duke of Cumberland, who is asked to "accept
the moral lay, and in these tales mankind survey." There
is skill and ingenuity in the poems, but higher merit they
cannot boast, and young readers are likely to prefer the
illustrations which generally accompany <i>The Fables</i> to the
letterpress. Many of Gay's allusions are beyond the apprehension
of the young, and have a political flavour. <i>The
Beggar's Opera</i> was intended as a burlesque of the Italian
opera, which had been long the laughing-stock of men of
letters, and as the play was thought to have political significance,
and the character of Macheath to be a portrait of
Walpole, it was received with enthusiasm, and acted in
London for about sixty nights. So popular did the opera
become, that ladies carried about the songs on their fans.</p>

<p>Eight years before, Gay had published his poems by
subscription, and in those happy days for versemen had
gained £1,000 by the venture. He put the money into
South Sea stock, and lost it all. For <i>The Beggar's
Opera</i> he received about £800. It was followed by <i>Polly</i>,
a play of the same coarse character, which, for political
reasons, was not allowed to be acted. The result was
that it had a large sale, and put money in Gay's purse.
Ten thousand five hundred copies are said to have been
printed in one year, and the £1,200 realized by the sale
were very wisely retained for the poet's use by the Duke
of Queensberry, under whose roof he had at length found
a warm nest. To the student Gay is chiefly interesting as
the only noteworthy poet of the period, south of the Tweed,
gifted with a lyrical capacity. Two or three of his songs
and ballads, and especially <i>Black-Eyed Susan</i>, have a charm
beyond the reach of the mechanical versifier. But the art
of song is at a low level even in the hands of Gay. The
lyric which the Elizabethan and Jacobean poets loved so
well, and of which the present century has produced speci<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>mens
to be matched only by Shakespeare, may be said to
have been lost to English poetry for the first half of the
last century, since neither Prior's verse, delightful though
it be, nor the songs of Gay, have enough of the poetical
element to form exceptions to this statement.</p>

<p>In his <i>Tales</i> he follows Prior in grossness, while inferior
to him in art. Like the greater number of the Queen
Anne poets, Gay flatters with a free hand. In an epistle
addressed to Lintot, the bookseller, he declares that
Anacreon lives once more in Sheffield, and Waller in Granville,
that Buckingham's verse will last to distant time;
while Ovid sings again in Addison, and 'Homer's <i>Iliad</i>
shines in his <i>Campaign</i>.'</p>

<p>One of the liveliest and most graceful of Gay's poems is
addressed to Pope 'On his having finished his translation
of Homer's <i>Iliad</i>.' It is called <i>A Welcome from Greece</i>, and
describes the friends who assembled to greet the poet on
his return to England.</p>

<p>Three stanzas from the Epistle shall be quoted:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Oh, what a concourse swarms on yonder quay!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sky re-echoes with new shouts of joy;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Who come in crowds to welcome thee from Troy.<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Gay's love of good living was known to all his friends.
'As the French philosopher,' Congreve wrote, 'used to
prove his existence by <i>cogito ergo sum</i>, the greatest proof
of Gay's existence is <i>edit ergo est</i>.' For a long time his
health compelled him to give up wine, and he tells Swift
that he had also left off verse-making, 'for I really
think that man must be a bold writer who trusts to
wit without it.' He was dispirited, he told Swift not
long before his death, for want of a pursuit, and found
'indolence and idleness the most tiresome things in the
world.'</p>

<p>Gay died in 1732 at the Duke of Queensberry's house,
and Pope grieved that one of his nearest and longest ties
was broken. He was interred, to quote Arbuthnot's words,
'as a peer of the realm,' in Westminster Abbey. The
superficial character of the poet may be seen in his couplet
transcribed upon the monument:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Life is a jest, and all things show it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought so once, and now I know it.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">Edward Young
(1684-1765).</div>

<p>Gay's moderate gift of song was withheld from the
famous author of the <i>Night Thoughts</i>. Yet
Young was vain enough to think that he
possessed it, and wrote a patriotic ode
called <i>Ocean</i>, preceded by an elaborate essay on lyric
poetry. He also produced <i>Imperium Pelagi</i> (1729), <i>A Naval
Lyric written in Imitation of Pindar's spirit</i>. The lyric,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
which was travestied by Fielding in his <i>Tom Thumb</i>,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> reads
like a burlesque, and badly treated though Pindar was by
the versemen of the last century, there is perhaps not
one of them who mocks him more outrageously than
Young. He says that this ode is an original, and no critic
is likely to dispute the assertion.</p>

<p>Young was born in 1684 at Upham, near Winchester, his
father, who was afterwards Dean of Sarum, being at that
time the rector of the village. Edward was placed upon
the foundation at Winchester College, and remained there
until he was eighteen. He was then sent up to New College,
and afterwards removed to Corpus. At the age of
twenty-seven he was nominated to a law fellowship at All
Souls, and took his degree of B.C.L. and his doctor's degree
some years later. Characteristically enough he began
his poetical career by <i>An Epistle to Lord Lansdowne</i> (1712),
who is praised for his heavenly numbers, and is said to
have been born "to make the muse immortal." His next
poem of any consequence, <i>The Last Day</i>, written in heroic
couplets, and filling three books, is correct, or fairly so, in
versification, and execrable in taste. Young, it may be
supposed, wished to produce a sense of solemnity in
the treatment of his theme, and he does so by lamenting
that the very land 'where the Stuarts filled an awful
throne' will in that day be forgotten. The want of
taste which so often deforms Young's verse is also seen
in the imagery he employs to illustrate the fear which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
even good men may have on appearing before that 'dread
tribunal.'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Thus the chaste bridegroom, when the priest draws nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beholds his blessing with a trembling eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feels doubtful passions throb in every vein,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his cheeks are mingled joy and pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest still some intervening chance should rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leap forth at once, and snatch the golden prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inflame his woe, by bringing it so late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stab him in the crisis of his fate.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His next poem, <i>The Force of Religion, or Vanquished
Love</i>, was suggested by the execution of Lady Jane Grey
and Lord Guildford, a subject chosen for a tragedy by John
Banks (1694), by Rowe in 1715, and treated with considerable
dramatic power in our own day by Ross Neil. In
Young's hands this fine theme becomes a rhetorical exercise
without poetry and without pathos. A few lines will
suffice to show the style of the poem. Jane and Dudley, it
must be premised, are imprisoned in a gloomy hall:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'What can they do? They fix their mournful eyes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Guildford, thus abruptly: "I despise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An empire lost; I fling away the crown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Numbers have laid that bright delusion down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But where's the Charles, or Dioclesian, where,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could quit the blooming, wedded, weeping fair?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! to dwell ever on thy lip! to stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In full possession of thy snowy hand!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thro' the unclouded crystal of thine eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heavenly treasures of thy mind to spy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till rapture reason happily destroys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my soul wanders through immortal joys!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give me the world, and ask me, where's my bliss?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I clasp thee to my breast and answer, this."'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Verse of this quality, which might be amply quoted, is
of interest to the student of literature, since in Young's
day it passed current for poetry. But in accepting his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
claims as a poet the faith of the age must have been often
strained.</p>

<p>Walpole, who despised the whole tribe of poets, and
cared nothing for literature, had by some strange chance
awarded to Young a pension of £200 a-year, whereupon in
a piece called <i>The Instalment</i>, addressed to Sir Robert,
Britain is called upon to behold</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'His azure ribbon and his radiant star,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and the poet's breast 'glows with grateful fire' as he exclaims:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The streams of royal bounty turned by thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refresh the dry domains of poesy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My fortune shows, when arts are Walpole's care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What slender worth forbids us to despair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be this thy partial smile from censure free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas meant for merit, though it fell on me.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Following in the steps of George Sandys, but with inferior
power, and in a less racy diction, Young performed
the vain task of paraphrasing part of the Book of Job, one
of the noblest poems the world possesses, and translated in
our authorized version in language not to be surpassed for
dignity and simplicity.</p>

<p>In 1719 his <i>Busiris</i> was performed. <i>The Revenge</i>, a
better known tragedy, written on the French model,
followed in 1721, and kept the stage for some time.
Seven years later <i>The Brothers</i>, his third and last tragedy,
was in rehearsal, but the poet, who had lately taken holy
orders, withdrew it at the last moment. These tragedies,
which are full of sound and fury, are destitute of tragic
power. <i>The Revenge</i>, in which Zanga acts the part of an
Iago, has some forcible scenes, and so, despite much rant
and fustian, has <i>Busiris</i>. Plenty of blood is shed, of
course, and the heroines of the plays die by their own
hands. Tragedy is supposed to exercise an elevating in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>fluence,
but to counteract this happy result, <i>Busiris</i> and
<i>The Revenge</i> are followed by indecent epilogues, in which
the speakers jest at the feelings which the plays may have
excited. For <i>The Brothers</i> Young wrote his own epilogue.
It is decent and dull. His genius was better fitted for
satire than for the drama, and <i>The Universal Passion</i>, which
consists of seven satires published in a collected form in 1728,
brought him reputation and money. The poet Crabbe was
never more surprised in his life than when John Murray
(the famous 'My Murray' of Byron) gave him £3,000
for the copyright of his poems; Young received the same
sum for work immeasurably inferior in value, and in a
less legitimate way. Two thousand pounds, it is stated,
was a gift from the Duke of Grafton, who said it was the
best bargain he ever made, as the satires were worth
£4,000. Young, it will be seen, preceded Pope as a
satirist. He is more generous and humane, and has
none of the venomous attacks on living persons by which
Pope added piquancy to his verse. But he is a careless
writer, and for the most part lacks the exquisite precision,
the subtle wit, the rhythmical felicity, which make the
couplets of Pope so memorable. <i>The Dunciad</i>, the <i>Moral
Essays</i>, and the <i>Imitations</i> are read by all lovers of literature,
but <i>The Universal Passion</i> is forgotten. Of the six
satires, the two on women are the most spirited, and may
be compared with Pope's on the same subject. The different
foibles, and faults worse than foibles of the women of
that day are exhibited with a satirist's licence, and occasionally
with a Pope-like terseness. Take the following,
for example:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'There is no woman where there's no reserve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And 'tis on plenty your poor lovers starve.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Few to good breeding make a just pretence;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good breeding is the blossom of good sense.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'A shameless woman is the worst of men.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Naked in nothing should a woman be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But veil her very wit with modesty.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was not until he was nearly fifty that Young, disappointed
of the preferment he sought, took holy orders,
and in 1730 accepted the college living of Welwyn, in
Herts, which he held till his death.</p>

<p>In the following year the poet married Lady Elizabeth
Lee, a daughter of the Earl of Lichfield, a union that
lasted ten years. One son was the offspring of this marriage.
Lady Elizabeth had a daughter by a former marriage,
who was married to Mr. Temple, a son of Lord Palmerston,
and shortly before her own death she lost both daughter
and son-in-law, who, there can be little doubt, are the
Philander and Narcissa of the <i>Night Thoughts</i>, the earlier
books of which were published in 1742. This once celebrated
poem, written in his old age, is the one effort of
Young's genius that has enjoyed a great popularity. It
suited well an age which, while far from moral, delighted
in moral treatises and in didactic verse. In the <i>Night
Thoughts</i> Young remembers that he is a clergyman, and
puts on his gown and bands. He puts on also his singing
robes, and shows the reader what none of his earlier poems
prove, that he is in the presence of a poet.</p>

<p>The <i>Night Thoughts</i> is remarkable in its finest passages
for a strong, but sombre imagination, and for a command
of his instrument that puts Young at times nearly on a
level with the greatest masters of blank verse. On this
height, however, he does not stay long. He is rich in great
thoughts, but they do not fall unconsciously, as it were,
while the poet pursues his argument. They are aphorisms
uttered generally in single lines which are apt to break the
continuity of the poem and to injure the harmony of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
versification. The theme of Life, Death, and Immortality
is not a narrow one, and affords ample space for imaginative
treatment. Young's treatment of it is too often declamatory;
he drops the poet in the rhetorician and the
wit. There is much of the false sublime in the poem,
and much that reveals the hollow character of the writer.
The first book is the finest, sparkling with felicitous expressions
and rising frequently to true poetry. The
poetical quality of that book, however, is lessened by the
author's passion for antithesis. The merit of the following
passage, for example, is not due to poetical inspiration:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'How poor, how rich, how abject, how august,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How complicate, how wonderful is man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How passing wonder He, who made him such!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who centered in our make such strange extremes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From different natures, marvellously mixed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Connexion exquisite of distant worlds!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Distinguished link in being's endless chain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Midway from nothing to the Deity;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A beam etherial, sullied, and absorbt!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though sullied and dishonoured still divine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dim miniature of greatness absolute!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An heir of glory! a frail child of dust!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Helpless immortal! insect infinite!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A worm! a god!&mdash;I tremble at myself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in myself am lost. At home a stranger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thought wanders up and down, surprised, aghast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wondering at her own: How reason reels!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O what a miracle to man is man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Triumphantly distressed! what joy! what dread!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alternately transported and alarmed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What can preserve my life? or what destroy?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An angel's arm can't snatch me from the grave:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Legions of angels can't confine me there.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The opening of the ninth and last book will give a more
favourable illustration of Young's style:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'As when a traveller, a long day past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In painful search of what he cannot find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At night's approach, content with the next cot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There ruminates awhile, his labour lost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then cheers his heart with what his fate affords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chants his sonnet to deceive the time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the due season calls him to repose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus I, long-travelled in the ways of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dancing with the rest the giddy maze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Disappointment smiles at Hope's career;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warned by the languor of life's evening ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length have housed me in an humble shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, future wandering banished from my thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waiting, patient, the sweet hour of rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I chase the moments with a serious song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Song soothes our pains, and age has pains to soothe.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>While moralizing on man's mortality Young is seldom a
cheerful monitor, he dwells with too great persistence on
the incidents of death and of bodily corruption, too little
on life with which we have more to do than with death.
Thus with a strange perversion he exclaims:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'This is the desart, this the solitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How populous, how vital, is the grave!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is creation's melancholy vault,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vale funereal, the sad cypress gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The land of apparitions, empty shades!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All, all on earth is shadow, all beyond<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is substance; the reverse is folly's creed.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and harping on the same theme in the ninth book,
says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'What is the world itself? Thy world&mdash;a grave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where is the dust that has not been alive?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spade, the plough, disturb our ancestors;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From human mould we reap our daily bread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The globe around earth's hollow surface shakes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And is the ceiling of her sleeping sons.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er devastation we blind revels keep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whole buried towns support the dancer's heel.'<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></div></div>

<div class="sidenote">Robert Blair
(1699-1746).</div>

<p>On laying down the <i>Night Thoughts</i> the student may be
advised to read Blair's <i>Grave</i>, a poem in
less than 800 lines of blank verse, composed
in a fresher and more rigorous style than the
far larger work of Young, and rather moulded, as Mr.
Saintsbury has observed, 'upon dramatic than upon purely
poetical models.' <i>The Grave</i>, which was written before the
publication of the <i>Night Thoughts</i>,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> abounds with poetical
felicities, and is pregnant with suggestions that seize the
imagination, and appeal alike to the intellect and the
heart. The brevity of the piece is in its favour; there is
not a line that flags.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tell us, ye dead! will none of you, in pity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To those you left behind, disclose the secret?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! that some courteous ghost would blab it out,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What 'tis you are and we must shortly be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've heard that souls departed have sometimes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forewarned men of their death. 'Twas kindly done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To knock and give the alarm. But what means<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This stinted charity? 'Tis but lame kindness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That does its work by halves. Why might you not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell us what 'tis to die? Do the strict laws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of your society forbid your speaking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a point so nice?&mdash;I'll ask no more:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sullen, like lamps in sepulchres, your shine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enlightens but yourselves. Well, 'tis no matter;<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
<p>Blair, who was a Scotch clergyman, wrote also an <i>Elegy
in Memory of William Law</i>, a Professor of Moral Philosophy
in Edinburgh, whose daughter he married. He writes
in a masculine and homely style. His imagery is often
more powerful than pleasing, but some of his similes win
attention by their beauty. For example:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Look how the fair one weeps! the conscious tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand thick as dewdrops on the bells of flowers."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Among the victims claimed by the grave is</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'The long demurring maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose lonely unappropriated sweets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiled, like yon knot of cowslips on the cliff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to be come at by the willing hand.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the death of a good man is pictured in this musical
couplet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Night dews fall not more gently to the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor weary worn out winds expire so soft.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Cowper, referring to the poets of his century, said that
every warbler had Pope's tune by heart. But if they
had the tune by heart, many of them did not make it a
vehicle for their verse, and among these are poets of the
weight and worth of Thomson and Young, of Gray and
Collins. Poets of a minor order, too, such as Somerville,
Armstrong, Glover, Shenstone, Akenside, and John Dyer,
either did not use the heroic distich which Pope crowned
with such honour, or used it in their least significant poems.</p>

<div class="sidenote">James Thomson
(1700-1748).</div>

<p>Thomson's influence, though less visible than Pope's,
was probably as great. It was felt by
the poets who loved Nature, and had no
turn for satire. To pass to him from
Prior, Gay, and Young is to leave the town for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
country. English poetry owes much to the author
of <i>The Seasons</i>, who was the first among the poets of
his century to bring men back to 'Nature, the Vicar of
the Almighty Lord.' He could not, indeed, shake off
altogether the fetters of the conventional diction current in
his day, and his style is often turgid and verbose. But
Thomson had, to use a phrase of his own, 'a fine flame of
imagination,' and when brought face to face with Nature
he has the inspiration of a poet who discerns the lessons
which Nature is ready to teach.</p>

<p>James Thomson was born at Ednam, on the banks of
the Tweed, on September 11th, 1700, but his father removed
to Jedburgh shortly afterwards, and there the future poet
gained his first impression of rural scenes. He began to
rhyme in boyhood, but, unlike most young poets, had the
good sense to make an annual bonfire of his youthful
effusions. At the early age of fifteen he was sent to the
university at Edinburgh, his father, who was a Presbyterian
minister, wishing that his son should follow the same vocation.
But Thomson was not destined to 'wag his head in
a pulpit.' He had a friend at this time in David Mallet,
a minor poet of more prudence than principle, and when
Mallet had the good fortune to gain a tutorship in London,
his companion also started for the metropolis in search of
money and fame. It was a desperate venture, and the
young poet's difficulties were increased by the loss of his
letters of introduction. Scotchmen however have always
countrymen willing to help them, and Thomson whose
pedigree on the mother's side connected him with the
famous house of Home, found temporary employment as
tutor to a child of Lord Binning who belonged by marriage
to the same family. Afterwards he resided with Millan, a
bookseller at Charing Cross, and then having finished
<i>Winter</i> (1726), on which he had been at work for some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
time, he sold it to the publisher for three guineas. Before
long it was read and warmly praised by Aaron Hill, then
a man of mark in the world of letters. Sir Spencer
Compton, the Speaker, to whom the poem was dedicated,
gave the poet twenty guineas for the compliment; Rundle,
the Bishop of Derry, and several ladies of rank cheered
him with their praise, and Thomson's success was assured.
It was the age of patrons, and he practised without shame
and without discrimination the art of flattery. Each book
of <i>The Seasons</i> had a dedication, and the honour was one
for which some kind of payment was expected. <i>Summer</i>
appeared in 1727 and <i>Spring</i> in the year following. In
1729 the appearance of <i>Britannia</i> showed the popularity of
the poet and of his theme, for three editions were sold. It
is a distinctly party poem, and contains an attack upon
Walpole&mdash;whom he had previously praised as the 'most
illustrious of patriots'&mdash;for submitting to indignities from
Spain. The British Lion roars loudly in it, but there is
more of fustian in the piece than of true patriotism. 'How
dares,' the poet exclaims, 'the proud Iberian rouse to wrath
the masters of the main:'</p>

<span class="i0">'Who told him that the big incumbent war<br /></span>

<p>In February, 1729-30, Thomson's tragedy of <i>Sophonisba</i>,
a subject previously chosen by Marston (1606), and by Lee
(1676), was acted at Drury Lane. The play was dedicated
to the queen, and on the opening night the house was
crowded, but the success of the piece was slight. Thomson's
genius was not dramatic, and while his characters declaim,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
they do not act. His next play, <i>Agamemnon</i> (1738),
was not lost for want of labour or of friends. Pope
appeared in the theatre on the first night, and was greeted
with applause. The Prince and Princess of Wales were
present on another occasion, but the play did not live
long. His third attempt, <i>Edward and Eleanora</i>, was prohibited
by the Lord Chamberlain, since it was supposed to
praise the Prince of Wales at the expense of the Court. In
1740 the <i>Masque of Alfred</i>, by Thomson and Mallet, was
performed. <i>Tancred and Sigismunda</i> followed in 1745, and
this tragedy, in which Garrick played the leading part, had
at the time a considerable measure of success. The plot is
more interesting than that of <i>Sophonisba</i>, and the characters
are more life-like. Despite its effusive sentiment,
Garrick's splendid acting would, no doubt, make the
tragedy effective on the stage, but it does not add to the
literary reputation of the poet. <i>Coriolanus</i>, Thomson's
last drama, was not performed upon the stage until the
year after his death.</p>

<p>Voltaire, who had met Thomson and liked him&mdash;the
liking, indeed, seemed to be universal&mdash;praised his tragedies
for being 'elegantly writ.' 'It may be,' he says,
'that his heroes are neither moving nor busy enough, but
taking him all in all, methinks he has the highest claim to
the greatest esteem.' The value of Voltaire's criticism of
an English dramatist is best appreciated by remembering
his ignorant judgment of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Thomson's laurels were gained in another field of poetry.
On the production of <i>Autumn</i> in 1730, <i>The Seasons</i> in
its complete form was published by subscription in quarto.
The four books, as we have already said, appeared at
different times, <i>Winter</i> being the first in order and <i>Autumn</i>
the latest. The Hymn with which the poem concludes
may be compared, and will not greatly suffer in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
comparison, with Adam's morning hymn in the fifth book
of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, and with Coleridge's <i>Hymn in the Valley
of Chamouni</i>. Like them it is raised, to use the poet's own
words, to an 'Almighty Father.' A brief extract shall
be given:</p>

<p>Swift complains that the <i>Seasons</i>, being all descriptive,
nothing is doing, a defect inseparable from the subject.
But the work has a poet's best gift&mdash;imagination&mdash;and a
poet's instinct for apprehending the charm of what is
minute in Nature, as well as of what is grand.</p>

<p>Thomson has been called the naturalist's poet, and
Hartley Coleridge observes that he is 'a perfect reservoir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
of natural images.' In his account of what he had learnt
only by report he depends sometimes on the ignorant
traditions of the country people; but in describing what
he observes with the bodily eye, and with the eye of the
mind, he is faithful to what he sees, and to what he perceives.
No Dutch painter can be more exact and accurate
than Thomson in the delineation of familiar scenes,
and of animal life. In illustration of this gift, which
Cowper shares with him, a scene, not to be surpassed
for truthfulness of description, shall be quoted from
<i>Winter</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Through the hushed air the whitening shower descends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At first thin-wavering; till at last the flakes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fall broad and wide and fast, dimming the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a continual flow. The cherished fields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put on their winter robe of purest white.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis brightness all; save where the new snow melts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the mazy current. Low the woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bow their hoar head; and ere the languid sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faint from the west, emits his evening ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth's universal face, deep-hid and chill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is one wild dazzling waste, that buries wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The works of man. Drooping, the labourer-ox<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stands covered o'er with snow, and then demands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fruit of all his toil. The fowls of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tamed by the cruel season, crowd around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winnowing store, and claim the little boon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Providence assigns them. One alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The redbreast, sacred to the household gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wisely regardful of th' embroiling sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In joyless fields and thorny thickets, leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His shivering mates, and pays to trusted man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His annual visit. Half afraid, he first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the window beats; then brisk, alights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the warm hearth; then, hopping o'er the floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eyes all the smiling family askance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pecks, and starts, and wonders where he is&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till more familiar grown, the table-crumbs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attract his slender feet. The foodless wilds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pour forth their brown inhabitants. The hare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though timorous of heart and hard beset<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By death in various forms, dark snares, and dogs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And more unpitying men, the garden seeks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urged on by fearless want. The bleating kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eye the bleak heaven, and next the glistening earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With looks of dumb despair; then, sad-dispersed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dig for the withered herb through heaps of snow.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thomson loves also to paint the landscape on a broad
scale, and though his diction is sometimes too florid, he
generally satisfies the imagination, as, for instance, in the
splendid description in <i>Summer</i> of a sand-storm in the
desert.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">'Breathed hot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From all the boundless furnace of the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wide, glittering waste of burning sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A suffocating wind the pilgrim smites<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With instant death. Patient of thirst and toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Son of the desert! even the camel feels,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shot through his withered heart, the fiery blast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or from the black-red ether, bursting broad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sallies the sudden whirlwind. Straight the sands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Commoved around, in gathering eddies play;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nearer and nearer still they darkening come;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till with the general all-involving storm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swept up, the whole continuous wilds arise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by their noonday fount dejected thrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or sunk at night in sad disastrous sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath descending hills, the caravan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is buried deep. In Cairo's crowded streets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The impatient merchant, wondering, waits in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mecca saddens at the long delay.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The <i>Seasons</i> was at one time, and for many years the
most popular volume of poetry in the country. It was
to be found in every cottage, and passages from the poem
were familiar to every school-boy. The appreciation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the work was more affectionate than critical, and Thomson's
faults were sometimes mistaken for beauties; but
the popularity of the <i>Seasons</i> was a healthy sign, and the
poem, a forerunner of Cowper's <i>Task</i>, brought into
vigorous life, feelings and sympathies that had been long
dormant.</p>

<p>Pope, who is twice mentioned in the poem, took a great
interest in its progress through the press. Thomson consulted
him frequently, and accepted many of his suggestions,
while apparently retaining at all times an independent
judgment. To the familiar episode of 'the lovely
young Lavinia' the following graceful passage is said, but
on very doubtful authority to have been added by Pope.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
The first line, given for the sake of the context, is from
Thomson's pen:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Thoughtless of beauty, she was Beauty's self,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recluse amid the close-embowering woods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in the hollow breast of Apennine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the shelter of encircling hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A myrtle rises, far from human eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breathes its balmy fragrance o'er the wild;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So flourished, blooming and unseen by all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sweet Lavinia; till, at length, compelled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By strong necessity's supreme command<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With smiling patience in her looks she went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To glean Palemon's fields.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thomson had now gained the highest mark of his fame,
and, like Pope, had won it in a few years. Nearly two
years of foreign travel followed, the poet having obtained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the post of governor to a son of the Solicitor-General. The
fruit of this tour was a long poem in blank verse on <i>Liberty</i>,
which probably gave him infinite labour, but his ascent
upon this occasion of what he calls 'the barren, but delightful
mountain of Parnassus,' was labour lost. It is
enough to say of <i>Liberty</i>, that it contains more than three
thousand lines of unreadable blank verse. Sinecures were
the rewards of genius in Thomson's day, and he was made
Secretary of Briefs in the Court of Chancery. He took a
cottage at Richmond, within an easy walk of Pope, and the
two poets met often and lived amicably.</p>

<p>Thomson did not enjoy his official fortune long, for his
patron died, and though he might have kept his post had
he applied to the Lord Chancellor, in whose gift it was,
he appears to have been too lazy to do so. His friend
Lyttelton in this emergency introduced him to the Prince
of Wales, who, on learning that his affairs 'were in a more
poetical posture than formerly,' gave him a pension of
£100 a year. There was no certainty in a gift of this
nature, and in about ten years it was withdrawn.</p>

<p><i>The Castle of Indolence</i> (1748) was the latest labour of
Thomson's life, and in the judgment of many critics takes
precedence of <i>The Seasons</i> in poetical merit. This verdict
may be questioned, but the poem, written in the Spenserian
stanza, has a soothing beauty and an enchanting
felicity of expression which show the poet's genius in a
new light. It is unlike any poetry of that age, and when
compared with <i>The Seasons</i>, the verse, as Wordsworth
justly says, 'is more harmonious and the diction more
pure.' All the imagery of the poem is adopted to the
vague and sleepy action of the characters represented in
it. It is a veritable poet's dream, which carries the
reader in its earliest stanzas into 'a pleasing land of
drowsy-head:'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'In lowly dale, fast by a river's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With woody hill o'er hill encompassed round,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A most enchanting wizard did abide,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than whom a fiend more fell is nowhere found.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It was, I ween, a lovely spot of ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And there a season atween June and May<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Half prankt with Spring, with Summer half embrowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A listless climate made, where, sooth to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No living wight could work, ne carèd even for play.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There are verbal inspirations in a great poet which satisfy
the ear, capture the imagination, and live in the memory
for ever. Milton's pages are studded with them like stars;
Gray has a few, Wordsworth many, and Keats some not to
be surpassed for witchery. Of such poetically suggestive
lines Thomson has his share, and although it seems unfair
to remove them from their context, the excision may be
made in a few cases, since they show not only that a new
poet had appeared in an age of prose, but a poet of a new
order, whose inspiration was felt by his successors. How
poetically imaginative is Thomson's imagery of the 'meek-eyed
morn, mother of dews;' of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ships dim discovered dropping from the clouds;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Autumn nodding o'er the yellow plain;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>of the summer wind</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Sweeping with shadowy gust the fields of corn;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and of the Hebrid-Isles</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Placed far amid the melancholy main,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>a line which may have suggested the lovelier verse of
Wordsworth descriptive of the cuckoo:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Breaking the silence of the seas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the farthest Hebrides.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thomson did not live long after the publication of <i>The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Castle of Indolence</i>. A cold caught upon the river led to a
fever, which ended fatally on August 27th, 1748. He had for
some years been in love with a Miss Young, the 'Amanda'
of his very feeble love lyrics, and her marriage is said to
have hastened his death. Men, however, do not die for love
at the mature age of forty-nine, and as Thomson was 'more
fat than bard beseems,' and was not always temperate in
his habits, constitutional causes are more likely to have led
to the poet's death than Amanda's cruelty.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson says somewhere that the further authors
keep apart from each other the better, and the literary
squabbles of the last century afforded him good ground
for the remark. It is to Thomson's credit that, like Goldsmith
twenty-six years later, he died, leaving behind him
many friends and not a single enemy. His fame rests
upon two poems, <i>The Seasons</i> and <i>The Castle of Indolence</i>,
and on a song which has gained a national reputation.
Apart from <i>Rule Britannia</i>, which appeared originally
in the <i>Masque of Alfred</i> and is spirited rather than poetical,
his attempts to write lyrical poetry resulted in failure; but
from his own niche in the Temple of Fame time is not
likely to dislodge Thomson.</p>

<h3>MINOR POETS.</h3>

<p class="hangindent">Sir Samuel Garth&mdash;Ambrose Philips&mdash;John Philips&mdash;Nicholas
Rowe&mdash;Aaron Hill&mdash;Thomas Parnell&mdash;Thomas Tickell&mdash;William
Somerville&mdash;John Dyer&mdash;William Shenstone&mdash;Mark Akenside&mdash;David
Mallet&mdash;Scottish Song-Writers.</p>


<div class="sidenote">Sir Samuel Garth
(1660-1717-18).</div>

<p>In Pope's day even the medical profession was influenced
by party feeling, and Samuel Garth became
known as the most famous Whig
physician, but his friendships were not
confined to one side, and he appears to have been universally
beloved.</p>

<p>Garth came of a Yorkshire family, and was born in 1660.
He was admitted a Fellow of the College of Physicians in
1693, gained a large practice, and is said to have been very
benevolent to the poor. The <i>Dispensary</i> (1699) is a satire
called forth by the opposition of the Society of Apothecaries,
to an edict of the College, and is a mock-heroic poem, which
the quarrel made so effective at the time that it passed
through several editions. The merit of achieving what the
satirist intended may therefore be granted to the <i>Dispensary</i>.
Few modern readers, however, will appreciate the
welcome it received, and it is ludicrous to read in Anderson's
edition of the poet that the poem 'is only inferior in
humour, discrimination of character, and poetical ardour
to the <i>Rape of the Lock</i>.' It would be far more accurate to
say that the <i>Dispensary</i> has not a single merit in common
with that poem, and but slight merit of any kind.</p>

<p>The following passage upon death is the most vigorous,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
and is interesting as having supplied Cowper with a line
in the poem on his Mother's Picture:<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">''Tis to the vulgar Death too harsh appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ill we feel is only in our fears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To die is landing on some silent shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where billows never break, nor tempests roar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere well we feel th' friendly stroke 'tis o'er.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wise through thought th' insults of death defy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fools through blest insensibility.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis what the guilty fear, the pious crave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sought by the wretch and vanquished by the brave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It eases lovers, sets the captive free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though a tyrant, offers liberty.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Addison in defending Garth in the <i>Whig-Examiner</i> from
the criticisms of Prior in the <i>Examiner</i>, the organ of the
Tory party, says he does not question but the author 'who
has endeavoured to prove that he who wrote the <i>Dispensary</i>
was no poet, will very suddenly undertake to show that he
who gained the battle of <i>Blenheim</i> is no general.' The
comparison was an unfortunate one. Marlborough's military
reputation has grown brighter with time, Garth's fame
as a poet has long ago ceased to exist.</p>

<p>A literary although not a poetical interest is associated
with the name of "well-natured Garth," who, as Pope
acknowledges, was one of his earliest friends; like Arbuthnot,
he lived among the wits, and as a member of the
famous Kit-cat Club he wrote verses upon the Whig
beauties toasted by its members. His name is linked
with Dryden's as well as with that of his illustrious
successor. It will be remembered how, on the death of
Dryden, the poet's body lay in state in the College of Phy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>sicians,
and how, before the great procession started for
Westminster Abbey, Sir Samuel, who was then President,
delivered a Latin oration.</p>

<p>Garth died in January, 1717-18, and, according to Pope,
was a good Christian without knowing it. Addison, however,
who visited Garth in his last illness, told Dr. Berkeley
that he rejected Christianity on the assurance of his friend
Halley that its doctrines were incomprehensible, and the
religion itself an imposture. According to another report
which comes through Pope, he actually 'died a papist.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ambrose Philips
(1671-1749).</div>

<p>Ambrose Philips, who belonged, like Tickell, to Addison's
'little senate,' was born in 1671, and
educated at St. John's, Cambridge. His
<i>Pastorals</i> were published in Tonson's <i>Miscellany</i>
(1709), and the same volume contained the <i>Pastorals</i>
of Pope. Log-rolling was understood in those days, and
Philips's verses received warm praise in more than one
number of the <i>Guardian</i>, the writer in one place declaring
that there have been only four masters of the art in above
two thousand years: 'Theocritus, who left his dominions
to Virgil; Virgil, who left his to his son Spenser; and
Spenser, who was succeeded by his eldest born, Philips.'</p>

<p>Pope's <i>Pastorals</i> were not mentioned, and in revenge he
devised the consummate artifice of sending an anonymous
paper to the <i>Guardian</i>, in which, while appearing to praise
Philips, he exalted himself. Steele took the bait, and considering
that the essay depreciated Pope would not publish
it without his permission, which was of course readily
granted. 'From that time,' says Johnson, 'Pope and
Philips lived in a perpetual reciprocation of malevolence.'</p>

<p>Philips's tragedy, <i>The Distrest Mother</i> (1712), a translation,
or nearly so, of Racine's <i>Andromaque</i>, was puffed in
the <i>Spectator</i>. It is the play to which Sir Roger de
Coverley was taken by his friends, and the representa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>tion
supplied the good knight with an opportunity for
much humorous comment.</p>

<p>'When Sir Roger saw Andromache's obstinate refusal
to her lover's importunities, he whispered me in the ear
that he was sure she would never have him; to which he
added with a more than ordinary vehemence, "You cannot
imagine, sir, what it is to have to do with a widow."
Upon Pyrrhus his threatening afterwards to leave her, the
knight shook his head, and muttered to himself, "Ay, do
if you can." This part dwelt so much upon my friend's
imagination that at the close of the third Act, as I was
thinking of something else, he whispered in my ear, "These
widows, sir, are the most perverse creatures in the world.
But pray," says he, "you that are a critic, is this play
according to your dramatic rules, as you call them? Should
your people in tragedy always talk to be understood?
Why, there is not a single sentence in this play that I do
not know the meaning of."'<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Addison also inserted and
praised in the <i>Spectator</i> Philips's translations from Sappho
(Nos. 223, 229).</p>

<p>His odes to babes and children earned for him the
<i>sobriquet</i> of 'Namby Pamby,' 'a term which has been incorporated
into the English language to designate mawkish
sentiment. Namby was the infantine pronunciation of
Ambrose, and Pamby was formed by the first letter of
Philips's surname and that reduplication of sound which
is natural to lisping children.'<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Between simplicity and absurdity the line is a narrow
one, and Philips stepped over it when he wrote to a child
in the nursery&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Dimply damsel, sweetly smiling,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Bud of beauty, fairly blowing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every charm to nature owing.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The longest of his baby songs is addressed to the Hon.
Miss Carteret, in which he pictures the child's progress to
womanhood, and anticipates her future loveliness and
maiden reign:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Then the taper-moulded waist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a span of ribbon braced;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the swell of either breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wide high-vaulted chest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the neck so white and round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little neck with brilliants bound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the store of charms which shine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above, in lineaments divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowded in a narrow space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To complete the desperate face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These alluring powers, and more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall enamoured youths adore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These and more in courtly lays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many an aching heart shall praise.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The inventory of the maiden's physical charms which follows
includes veiny temples, sloping shoulders, a hazely
lucid eye, and cheek of health; but in the category the
only allusion to the attractions of intellect and heart is in
a couplet foretelling her</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">'Gentleness of mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gentle from a gentle kind.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That Philips translated <i>The Persian Tales</i> is indelibly
recorded by Pope:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The bard whom pilfered Pastorals renown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who turns a Persian tale for half-a-crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just writes to make his barrenness appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strains from hard-bound brains eight lines a year.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But even Pope could award praise to Philips. In a letter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
to Henry Cromwell, in 1710, he observes that he was capable
of writing very nobly, 'as I guess by a small copy of his,
published in the <i>Tatler</i>, on the Danish winter;' and two
years later he says to his friend Caryll: 'Mr. Philips has
two lines which seem to me what the French call very
<i>picturesque</i>, that I cannot omit to you:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'All hid in snow in bright confusion lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with one dazzling waste fatigue the eye!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The lines, not quite accurately quoted by Pope, are from
an epistle, addressed to Lord Dorset from Copenhagen,
which contains a few striking couplets, two of which may
be transcribed before bidding adieu to Ambrose Philips:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The vast leviathan wants room to play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spout his waters in the face of day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The starving wolves along the main sea prowl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the moon in icy valleys howl.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">John Philips
(1676-1708).</div>

<p>Ambrose Philips must not be confounded with his namesake
John, the author of a clever burlesque
of Milton, called <i>The Splendid Shilling</i> (1705);
of <i>Blenheim</i> (1705), a poem which he was
urged to write by the Tories in opposition to Addison's
<i>Campaign</i>; and of a poem upon <i>Cider</i> (1706), in 'Miltonian
verse,' which seems to have afforded several suggestions to
Pope in his <i>Windsor Forest</i>. It is said to display a considerable
knowledge of the subject, and in that its principal
merit consists. From <i>The Splendid Shilling</i> a brief extract
may be given:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'So pass my days. But when nocturnal shades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This world envelop, and th' inclement air<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Me, lonely sitting, nor the glimmering light<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span><br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>'Philips,' says the poet Campbell, 'had the merit of
studying and admiring Milton, but he never could imitate
him without ludicrous effect, either in jest or earnest. His
<i>Splendid Shilling</i> is the earliest and one of the best of our
parodies; but <i>Blenheim</i> is as completely a burlesque upon
Milton as <i>The Splendid Shilling</i>, though it was written and
read with gravity, ... yet such are the fluctuations of
taste that contemporary criticism bowed with solemn
admiration over his Miltonic cadences.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nicholas Rowe
(1673-1718).</div>

<p>Nicholas Rowe had the honour, if it was one in those
days, of being made Laureate on the accession
of George I. His odes, epistles, and
songs are without merit, but he gained
reputation as the translator of Lucan's <i>Pharsalia</i>, of which
Sir Arthur Gorges had produced a version in 1614, and
his plays entitle him to a place, though not a high one, in
our dramatic literature.</p>

<p>Rowe edited an edition of Shakespeare, and should
have known his author, yet in a prologue he declares that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
he could not draw women&mdash;an amazing assertion echoed
by Collins, who praises Fletcher for his knowledge of the
'female mind,' and adds that 'stronger Shakespeare felt
for man alone.'</p>

<p>The chronological list of Rowe's dramas runs as
follows: <i>The Ambitious Step-mother</i> (1700); <i>Tamerlane</i>
(1702); <i>The Fair Penitent</i> (1703); <i>Ulysses</i> (1705); <i>The
Royal Convert</i> (1707); the <i>Tragedy of Jane Shore</i>
(1714); and the <i>Tragedy of Lady Jane Grey</i> (1715).
Measured by his contemporary dramatists he is a distinguished
playwright. His characters do not live, but he
could invent effective scenes, though in some cases the poet's
taste may be questioned.</p>

<p>For many years <i>Tamerlane</i> was acted at Drury Lane on
the anniversary of King William's landing in England, and
under the names of Tamerlane and Bajazet the king is belauded
at the expense of Louis XIV. <i>The Fair Penitent</i>,
a piece even more successful upon the stage, will still
please the reader, though he may question the high eulogium
of Johnson, that "scarcely any work of any poet is at
once so interesting by the fable, and so delightful by the
language." Rowe has not the tragic power which can express
passion without rant, and pathos without extravagance.
In <i>The Fair Penitent</i> Calista gives utterance to
her feelings by piling up expletives. Thus, when her
husband attacks the lover who has ruined her, she exclaims,
'Destruction! fury! sorrow! shame! and death!'
and, on another occasion, she cries out, 'Madness! confusion!'
words which give a sense of the ludicrous rather
than of the tragic; and so also does Calista's last utterance
when, addressing Altamont, she says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">'Had I but early known<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy wondrous worth, thou excellent young man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We had been happier both&mdash;now 'tis too late!'<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Rowe may be regarded as the principal representative of
tragedy in the 'age of Pope,' but his respectable work
shows a fatal degeneration from the 'gorgeous tragedy'
of the Elizabethans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aaron Hill
(1684-1749).</div>

<p>Aaron Hill, unlike Rowe, was not distinguished as a
dramatist, and succeeded only in two or three
adaptations from the French. His claims as a
poet are also insignificant. He was born in
London in 1684, with expectations that were not destined to
be realized, but Fortune was not unkind to him. His uncle,
Lord Paget, Ambassador at Constantinople, gave the youth
a warm welcome, supplied him with a tutor, and sent him to
travel in the East. On Lord Paget's return to England, Hill
accompanied him, and together they are said to have visited
a great part of Europe. Some time later Hill went abroad
again, and was absent two or three years. For awhile&mdash;it
could not have been long&mdash;he was secretary to the Earl of
Peterborough, and at the age of twenty-six, his good star
being still in the ascendant, he married a young lady 'of
great merit and beauty, with whom he had a very handsome
fortune.' Hill was then appointed manager of Drury Lane,
and he wrote a number of plays, the very names of which
are now forgotten. Few men indeed so well known in his
own day have sunk into such insignificance in ours. He
wrote eight books of a long and unfinished epic called
<i>Gideon</i>, which I suppose no one in the present century has
had the hardihood to read; like Young he wrote a poem
on <i>The Judgment Day</i>, a theme attempted also, shortly
before his death, by John Philips, and that, after his kind,
he produced a Pindaric ode goes without saying. A long
poem called <i>The Northern Star</i>, a panegyric on Peter the
Great, is said to have passed through several editions.
The poem does not prove Hill to be a poet, but it shows
his command of the heroic couplet. The style of the poem,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
which is an indiscriminate panegyric, may be judged from
the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Transcendent prince! how happy must thou be!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What can'st thou look upon unblessed by thee?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What inward peace must that calm bosom know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence conscious virtue does so strongly flow!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Such are the kings who make God's image shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor blush to dare assert their right divine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No earth-born bias warps their climbing will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No pride their power, no avarice whets their skill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They poise each hope which bids the wise obey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shed broad blessings from their widening sway;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To raise the afflicted, stretch the healing hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drive crushed oppression from each rescued land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bold in alternate right, or sheath or draw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sword of conquest, or the sword of law;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spare what resists not, what opposes bend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And govern cool, what they with warmth defend.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Hill has the merit of having turned the tables upon
Pope, who had put him into the treatise on the <i>Bathos</i>,
and then into the <i>Dunciad</i>, where, however, the lines have
more of compliment than censure, since he is made to
mount 'far off among the swans of Thames.' Irritated
by a note in the <i>Dunciad</i>, Hill replied in a long poem
entitled <i>The Progress of Wit, a Caveat</i>, which opens with
the following pointed lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tuneful Alexis, on the Thames' fair side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ladies' plaything, and the Muses' pride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With merit popular, with wit polite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Easy though vain, and elegant though light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Desiring, and deserving others' praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poorly accepts a fame he ne'er repays;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unborn to cherish, sneakingly approves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wants the soul to spread the worth he loves.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In a letter to Hill Pope complained of these lines, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
had the hypocrisy to say that he never thought any great
matters of his poetical capacity, but prided himself on the
superiority of his moral life. Hill returned a masterly
and incisive reproof to this ridiculous statement, in the
course of which he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'I am sorry to hear you say you never thought any
great matters of your poetry. It is in my opinion the
characteristic you are to hope your distinction from. To
be honest is the duty of every plain man. Nor, since the
soul of poetry is sentiment, can a great poet want morality.
But your honesty you possess in common with a million
who will never be remembered; whereas your poetry is a
peculiar, that will make it impossible that you should be
forgotten.'</p></div>

<p>He adds that if Pope had not been in the spleen when he
wrote, he would have remembered that humility is a moral
virtue; and how, asks the writer, can you know that your
moral life is above that of most of the wits 'since you tell
me in the same letter that many of their names were
unknown to you?'</p>

<p>Aaron Hill, though he could write a sensible letter,
was not a wise man. He was 'everything by turns and
nothing long.' Poetry was but one of his accomplishments,
and we are told that he cultivated it 'as a relaxation
from the study of history, criticism, geography, physic,
commerce, agriculture, war, law, chemistry, and natural
philosophy, to which he devoted the greatest part of his
time.'</p>

<p>As a poet Hill has the facility in composition exhibited
by so many of his contemporaries, and he has occasionally
a pretty turn of fancy. His last labour was the successful
adaptation of Voltaire's <i>Merope</i> to the English stage (1749);
sixteen years before he had adapted <i>Zara</i> with equal
success.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Thomas Parnell
(1679-1718).</div>

<p>Among the minor poets of the period an honourable
place must be given to Parnell, who possessed
the soul of a poet, but gave limited
expression to it, for it was only during the
later years of a short life that he discovered where his
genius lay. The friend of Pope, Arbuthnot, and Swift,
his biography has been written by Johnson, and more discursively
by his countryman Goldsmith.</p>

<p>Thomas Parnell was born in Dublin, 1679, entered Trinity
College at the early age of thirteen, and in 1700 obtained the
degree of Master of Arts. Having taken orders he gained
preferment in the Church, became, in 1706, Archdeacon of
Clogher, and through the recommendation of Swift obtained
also a good living. Parnell was fond of society, and was
accustomed as often as possible to join the wits in London.
He was a member of the Scriblerus Club, wrote for the
<i>Spectator</i>, preached eloquent sermons, and had the ambition
of a poet. But the loss of his wife preyed upon his mind,
and he is said, though I believe chiefly on Pope's authority,
to have given way to intemperance. He died suddenly at
Chester at the age of thirty-nine in 1718.</p>

<p>Parnell was one of the poets whose fortunes Swift did
his best to promote. Writing in 1712, he says, 'I gave Lord
Bolingbroke a poem of Parnell's. I made Parnell insert
some compliments in it to his lordship. He is extremely
pleased with it, and read some parts of it to-day to Lord
Treasurer, who liked it as much. And indeed he outdoes
all our poets here a bar's length.' And a month later he
writes, 'Lord Bolingbroke likes Parnell mightily, and it is
pleasant to see that one who hardly passed for anything in
Ireland, makes his way here with a little friendly forwarding.'</p>

<p><i>The Hermit</i>, the <i>Hymn to Contentment</i>, an <i>Allegory on
Man</i>, and a <i>Night Piece on Death</i>, give Parnell his title<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
to a place among the poets. <i>The Rise of Woman</i>, and <i>Health,
an Eclogue</i>, have also much merit, and were praised by
Pope (but this was to their author) as 'two of the
most beautiful things he ever read.' The story of <i>The
Hermit</i>, written originally in Spanish, is given in <i>Howell's
Letters</i> (1645-1655), and is admirably told by Parnell,
but much that he wrote, including a series of long
poems on Scripture characters, is poetically worthless.
His poems, published five years after his death, were
edited by Pope, who wisely suppressed some pieces unworthy
of the poet. Then, as now, literary scavengers
were at work. In 1758 the suppressed poems were published,
and called forth the comment from Gray, 'Parnell
is the dunghill of Irish Grub Street.' To Parnell Pope
was indebted for the <i>Essay on Homer</i> prefixed to the translation,
with which he does not seem to have been well
pleased. He complained of the stiffness of the style, and
said it had cost him more pains in the correcting than the
writing of it would have done.</p>

<p>If Parnell's prose has the defect of stiffness, his lines
glide with a smoothness that must have satisfied the ear of
Pope. The higher harmonies of verse were unknown to
him, but ease is not without a charm, and in illustration of
Parnell's gift the final lines of <i>A Night Piece on Death</i>
shall be quoted:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="sidenote">Thomas Tickell
(1686-1740).</div>

<p>Tickell wished to be remembered as the friend of Addison,
and with Addison his name is indissolubly
associated. The poem dedicated
to the essayist's memory is perhaps over-praised
by Macaulay when he says that it would do honour
to the greatest name in our literature, but it proved incontestibly
that Tickell, as a poet, was superior to the master
whom he so loved and honoured. His reputation hangs
upon this elegy, which Fox pronounced perfect.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The <i>Prospect
of Peace</i>, which passed through several editions, had
at one time a considerable reputation, not assuredly for its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
poetry, but because it appealed to the spirit of the time
The style of the poem may be judged from these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Accept, great Anne, the tears their memory draws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who nobly perished in their sovereign's cause;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thou in pity bidd'st the war give o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mourn'st thy slain heroes, nor wilt venture more.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That Marlborough conquered and that Dormer fell.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His <i>Colin and Lucy</i> called forth high praise from Goldsmith
as one of the best ballads in our language, and Gray
terms it the prettiest ballad in the world. Three stanzas
from this once famous poem shall be quoted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>There is some fancy but no imagination in the machinery
of Tickell's long poem on <i>Kensington Gardens</i>, a title which
recalls Matthew Arnold's exquisite stanzas. But the pathetic
beauty of Arnold's lines belongs to a world of poetry wholly
unlike that in which even the best of the Queen Anne poets
lived and moved.</p>

<p>Tickell's translation of the first book of the <i>Iliad</i> led to
the quarrel already mentioned in the account of Pope. He
wrote, also, a rather lengthy poem on Oxford, in which there
is some absurd criticism of insignificant poetasters, and,
as a matter of course, an extravagant eulogium of Addison.</p>

<p>The few facts recorded of Tickell's life may be summed
up in a paragraph. He was born in 1686 at Bridekirk, in
Cumberland, and entered Queen's College, Oxford, in 1701.
In 1708 he obtained his M.A. degree, and two years later
was chosen Fellow. For sixteen years Tickell held his
fellowship, but resigned it on his marriage in 1726. In
a poem addressed to the lady before marriage, he asks
whether</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'By thousands sought, Clotilda, canst thou free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy crowd of captives and descend to me?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Praise which in those days would be regarded as fulsome
secured the friendship and patronage of Addison, who
employed him in public affairs, and when he became Secretary
of State made Tickell Under-Secretary. To him Addison
left the charge of editing his works, which were published
by subscription, and appeared in four quarto volumes
in 1721. In 1725 he was made secretary to the Lord Justices
of Ireland, 'a place of great honour,' which he held
until his death in 1740. The praise of Wordsworth, a poet
always chary of expressing approbation, has been bestowed
upon Tickell. 'I think him,' he said, 'one of the very best
writers of occasional verses.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">William Somerville
(1692-1742).</div>

<p>Tickell had written some lines on hunting, which he
published as a fragment. His contemporary
Somerville, selecting the same
subject, wrote <i>The Chase</i> (1735), a poem
in blank verse. He was born at Edston, in Warwickshire,
and was said, Dr. Johnson writes, 'to be of the first family
in his county.' He was educated at Winchester and Oxford,
and had the tastes of a scholar as well as of a country
gentleman, which, among other accomplishments, included
that of hard drinking. We know little about him, and
what we do know is deplorable, for his friend Shenstone
writes that he was plagued and threatened by low wretches,
and 'forced to drink himself into pains of the body in order
to get rid of the pains of the mind.' He died in 1742, the
owner of a good estate, which, owing to a contempt for
economy, he was never able to enjoy. 'I loved him for
nothing so much,' said Shenstone, 'as for his flocci-nauci-nihili-pili-fication
of money.'</p>

<p>In <i>The Chase</i> Somerville had the advantage of knowing
his subject, but knowledge is not poetry, and the interest
of the poem is not due to its poetical qualities. He deserves
some credit for his skill in handling a variety of
metres as well as blank verse, in which his principal poem
is written. In an address <i>To Mr. Addison</i>, the couplet,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'When panting Virtue her last efforts made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You brought your Clio to the virgin's aid,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is praised by Johnson as one of those happy strokes which
are seldom attained. In the same poem Shakespeare and
Addison are brought together in a way that is far from
happy:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'In heaven he sings; on earth your muse supplies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' important loss, and heals our weeping eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Correctly great, she melts each flinty heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With equal genius, but superior art.'<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Praise can be too strong even for a poet's digestion, and
Somerville, who writes a great deal more nonsense in the
same strain, should have remembered that he was not
addressing a fool. If the poetical adulation of the time is
to be excused, it must be on the ground that a poet had to
live by patronage and not by the public. In a pecuniary
point of view his subservience to men in high position was
often successful. An almost universal custom, it was not
regarded as degrading; but the poet must have been peculiarly
constituted who was not degraded by it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John Dyer
(1698(?)-1758).</div>

<p>In the last century any subject was deemed suitable for
poetry, and the Welsh poet, John Dyer, who was
born about 1698, found in his later life poetical
materials in <i>The Fleece</i> (1757), a poem in four
books of blank verse. His genius for descriptive poetry and
his passionate and intelligent delight in natural objects are
seen more pleasantly in <i>Grongar Hill</i> (published in the
same year as Thomson's <i>Winter</i>), a poem not without grammatical
inaccuracies, one of which deforms the first couplet,
but full of poetical feeling. In an ease of composition
which runs into laxity he reminds us occasionally of George
Wither. His chief merit is, that while independent of
Thomson, he was inspired by the same love, and wrote
with the same aim. Dyer is not content with bare description,
but likes to moralize on the landscape he surveys.
Thus, when looking on a ruined tower, the poet exclaims:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Yet time has seen, that lifts the low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And level lays the lofty brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has seen this broken pile compleat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Big with the vanity of state;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But transient is the smile of fate!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little rule, a little sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sunbeam in a winter's day,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is all the proud and mighty have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the cradle and the grave.'<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Dyer who is best seen in the octosyllabic metre, chose it
also for <i>The Country Walk</i>, a poem in which, notwithstanding
an occasional lapse into the conventional diction
of the period, the rural pictures are drawn from life. He
takes the reader into the farm-yard and fields as he writes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I am resolved this charming day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the open field to stray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have no roof above my head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that whereon the gods do tread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the yellow barn I see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A beautiful variety<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of strutting cocks, advancing stout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flirting empty chaff about;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hens, ducks, and geese, and all their brood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turkeys gobbling for their food;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While rustics thrash the wealthy floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tempt all to crowd the door.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now into the fields I go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where thousand flaming flowers glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every neighbouring hedge I greet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With honey-suckles smelling sweet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now o'er the daisy meads I stray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And meet with, as I pace my way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweetly shining on the eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rivulet gliding smoothly by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which shows with what an easy tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moments of the happy glide.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>An Epistle to a Friend in Town</i>, records his satisfaction with
the country retirement in which his days are passed. In a
rather awkward stanza he says that he is more than content,
and is indeed charmed with everything, and the lines
close with the moralizing that was dear to Dyer's heart:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Alas! what a folly that wealth and domain<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We heap up in sin and in sorrow!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immense is the toil, yet the labour how vain!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is not life to be over to-morrow?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then glide on my moments, the few that I have,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Smooth-shaded and quiet and even;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While gently the body descends to the grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the spirit arises to heaven.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Dyer was an artist as well as a poet, and visited Italy,
which suggested a poem in blank verse, <i>The Ruins of
Rome</i> (1740). After his return to England he entered into
holy orders, took a wife, who is said to have been a descendant
of Shakespeare, and settled at Calthorp in Leicestershire,
which he afterwards exchanged for a living in
Lincolnshire. There is much to like in Dyer, and he has
had the good fortune to win the applause of two great
poets. Gray says, in a letter to Horace Walpole, that
he had 'more of poetry in his imagination than almost any
of our number,' and Wordsworth in a sonnet, <i>To the Poet,
John Dyer</i>, writes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Though hasty Fame hath many a chaplet culled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For worthless brows, while in the pensive shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of cold neglect she leaves thy head ungraced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet pure and powerful minds, hearts meek and still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A grateful few, shall love thy modest Lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long as the shepherd's bleating flock shall stray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er naked Snowdon's wide aerial waste;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long as the thrush shall pipe on Grongar Hill!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">William Shenstone
(1714-1764).</div>

<p>'The true rustic style,' Charles Lamb writes, 'I think is
to be found in Shenstone,' and he calls
his <i>Schoolmistress</i> the 'prettiest of poems.'</p>

<p>William Shenstone was born in 1714 at the Leasowes in
Hales-Owen, a spot upon which he afterwards expended his
skill as a landscape gardener. In 1732 he went up to
Pembroke College, Oxford, and remained there for some
years without taking a degree. Those years appear to
have been devoted to poetry. In 1737 Shenstone published<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
a small volume anonymously. This was followed by the
<i>Judgment of Hercules</i> (1741), and by the <i>Schoolmistress</i>
(1742). In 1745 he undertook the management of his
estate, and began, to quote Dr. Johnson's quaint description,
'to point his prospects, to diversify his surface, to entangle
his walks, and to wind his waters; which he did with such
judgment and such fancy, as made his little domain the
envy of the great and the admiration of the skilful; a
place to be visited by travellers and copied by designers.'
On this estate, with its lakes and cascades, its urns and
poetical inscriptions, its hanging woods, and 'wild shaggy
precipice,' Shenstone appears to have spent all his fortune.
He led the life of a dilettante, and died unmarried at the
age of fifty. His elegies and songs are dead, and whatever
vitality remains in his verse will be found in the <i>Pastoral
Ballad</i> and the <i>Schoolmistress</i>.</p>

<p>The ballad written in anapæstic verse has an Arcadian
grace, against which even Johnson's robust intellect was
not proof. For the following lines he says, 'if any mind
denies its sympathy it has no acquaintance with love or
nature':</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'When forced the fair nymph to forego,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What anguish I felt in my heart!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I thought&mdash;but it might not be so&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Twas with pain that she saw me depart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She gazed as I slowly withdrew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My path I could hardly discern;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sweetly she bade me adieu,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I thought that she bade me return.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The <i>Schoolmistress</i>, written in imitation of Spenser, has
the merits of simplicity and homely humour. The village
dame is a life-like character, and the urchins whom she is
supposed to teach, and does sometimes teach by chastisement,
are cunningly portrayed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>From the verses <i>Written at an Inn in Henley</i> three
stanzas may be quoted. The last will be already known
to readers familiar with their Boswell:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I fly from pomp, I fly from plate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I fly from falsehood's specious grin!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freedom I love, and form I hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And choose my lodgings at an inn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Here, waiter! take my sordid ore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which lacqueys else might hope to win;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It buys what courts have not in store,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It buys me freedom at an inn!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Whoe'er has travelled life's dull round,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where'er his stages may have been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May sigh to think he still has found<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The warmest welcome at an inn.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Unhappily this final verse, which Johnson is said to have
repeated 'with great emotion,' has lost its application.
The modern traveller, instead of being warmly welcomed
at an inn, loses his identity and becomes a number.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mark Akenside
(1721-1770).</div>

<p>Akenside, who was born at Newcastle, 1721, received his
education in Edinburgh, where he was
sent to prepare for the ministry among
the Dissenters. He, however, changed
his mind, became a medical student, and finally, though
much disliked for his manners, gained reputation as a physician
in London. He is stated to have been excessively
stiff and formal, and a frigid stiffness marks the <i>Pleasures
of Imagination</i> (1744), a remarkable work considering the
writer's age, since it is without the faults of youth. The
poem is founded on Addison's <i>Essays</i> on the subject in the
<i>Spectator</i>, and the poet also owes a considerable debt to
Shaftesbury. Akenside's blank verse has the merits of
dignity and strength. But the work is as cold as the
author's manners were said to be, and in spite of what may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
be called poetical power, as distinct from a high order of
inspiration, the poem leaves the reader unmoved. Pope,
who saw it in MS., said that Akenside was 'no everyday
writer,' which is a just criticism. The <i>Pleasures of Imagination</i>
has the merits of careful workmanship and of some
originality, but the interest which it at one time excited is
not likely to be revived. In 1757 Akenside re-wrote the
poem, and I believe that no critic, with the exception of
Hazlitt, regards the second attempt as an improvement
on the first. His skill in the use of classical imagery is
seen to advantage in the <i>Hymn to the Naiads</i> (1746), and
he deserves praise, too, for his inscriptions, which are distinguished
for conciseness and vigour of style. The poet,
it may be added, wrote a great number of odes that lack
all, or nearly all, the qualities which should distinguish
lyrical poetry. Not a spark of the divine fire warms or
illuminates these reputable verses, but the author states
that his chief aim was to be correct, and in that he has
succeeded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">David Mallet
(1700-1765).</div>

<p>David Mallet, a friend or acquaintance of Thomson, was
contemptible as a man and comparatively
insignificant as a poet. He did a large
amount of dirty work, and appears to have
made a good income by it. The base character of the man
was known to Bolingbroke, of whose basest purpose he
made him the instrument (see c. vii.). Mallet's ballad of
<i>William and Margaret</i> (1724) is known to many readers,
and so is the inferior ballad <i>Edwin and Emma</i>, which was
written many years afterwards. In 1728 he published
<i>The Excursion</i>, a poem not sufficiently significant to prevent
Wordsworth from selecting the same title. In Mallet's
poem on <i>Verbal Criticism</i> (1733), Johnson states that he
paid court to Pope, and was rewarded by a travelling
tutorship gained through the poet's influence. In 1731 his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
tragedy, <i>Eurydice</i>, was acted at Drury Lane. He joined
Thomson, as we have said elsewhere, in the composition of
the masque of <i>Alfred</i>, and 'almost wholly changed' the
piece after Thomson's death. <i>Amyntor and Theodora</i>, a
long poem in blank verse, appeared in 1747; <i>Britannia</i>,
a masque, in 1753, and <i>Elvira</i>, a tragedy, in 1763. Mallet,
who was without qualifications for the task, wrote a life of
Lord Bacon. He is said to have obtained a pension for
inflaming the mind of the public against Admiral Byng,
and thereby hastening his execution.</p>

<p>In Anderson's edition of the poets, Mallet's biography is
related with more fulness than by Dr. Johnson, and, after
frankly recording acts which fully justify Macaulay's statement
that Mallet's character was infamous, the writer
adds, 'his integrity in business and in life is unimpeached.'</p>


<p class="center gap3"><span class="smcap">Scottish Song-Writers.</span></p>

<p>When the poets of England were writing satires, moral
essays, and elaborate didactic treatises, the poets of Scotland
were singing, in bird-like notes, songs of humour and
of love. It is remarkable that the Scotch, the shrewdest,
hardest, and most business-like people in these islands,
should be so richly endowed with a gift shared and enjoyed
by rich and poor alike. The most exquisite of English
lyrics fall, where culture is wanting, on regardless ears;
the songs of Ramsay and of Burns, of Lady Anne Lindsay
and Jane Elliot, of Hogg and Lady Nairne, of Tannahill
and Macneil, are household words in Scotland to
gentle and simple. A few of the choicest songs of Scotland
are due to ladies of rank, but the larger number have
sprung from 'the huts where poor men lie.' Ramsay was a
barber and wig-maker; Burns, as all the world knows,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
followed the plough; Tannahill was a weaver; Hogg a
shepherd; and Robert Nicoll the son of a small farmer,
'ruined out of house and hold.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Allan Ramsay
(1686-1758).</div>

<p>Allan Ramsay was, born at Leadhills, in Lanarkshire, in
1686, and was therefore Pope's senior by
two years. He has been called 'the restorer
of Scottish poetry,' and by his compilation
of <i>The Evergreen</i> (1724), and of <i>The Tea-Table
Miscellany</i>, published in the same year, he gathered up
the wealth of song scattered through the country. <i>The
Miscellany</i> extended to four volumes, and before the poet's
death had reached twelve editions. An undying interest
belongs to both anthologies. <i>The Evergreen</i> was the first
poetry Walter Scott perused, and in a marginal note on
his copy of <i>The Tea-Table Miscellany</i> he writes: 'This book
belonged to my grandfather, Robert Scott, and out of it I
was taught <i>Hardiknute</i> by heart before I could read the
ballad myself. It was the first poem I ever learnt, the
last I shall ever forget.' The ballad Scott loved so well, I
may say in passing, was written as a whole or in part by
Lady Wardlaw (1677-1727),<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and belongs therefore either
to our period or to the later years of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>In 1725 Ramsay published <i>The Gentle Shepherd</i>, a pastoral
that puts to shame the numerous semi-classical and
mythological poems which appeared under that name in
England. It is essentially a rural poem, in which the
action and language harmonize with what we know, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
think we know, of country manners and life. There is
neither striking invention in the plot nor much individuality
in the characters, but there is poetical harmony
throughout, many pretty rustic scenes, and sufficient interest
to carry the reader pleasantly over the ground. <i>The
Gentle Shepherd</i> is the work of a poet, and gives a higher
impression of Ramsay's power than his songs alone would
warrant. His lyrical pieces, though not wholly without
the lilt and charm such verse exacts, are perhaps mainly
of service in showing the immeasurable superiority of
Burns. Ramsay was a successful poet, and not too much
of a poet to be also a successful man of business.
He exchanged wig-making for bookselling, kept a shop
in the High Street of Edinburgh, and finally retired
to a villa which he had built for himself on the Castle
Hill. A good-humoured, care-defying man, he enjoyed
life in an easy way, and was not disposed to repine when
his road lay down the hill. In an epistle to a friend he
writes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">With calmness view the edge of life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when a full ripe age shall crave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slide easily into my grave.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Among the Scottish song-writers of the period may be
mentioned Robert Crawford (1695?-1732), whose love
verses, written in a conventional strain, are not without
music; Lord Binning (1696-1732), the author of a pretty
song called <i>Ungrateful Nanny</i>; and William Hamilton of
Bangour (1704-1754), who wrote the well-known <i>Braes of
Yarrow</i>. The most charming of Scottish lyrics belong,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
however, to a later period of the century than the age of
Pope.</p>


<p class="gap3">The student who reads the minor poets who figured, in
some cases with much applause, during the years of Pope's
ascendency, will be struck by the almost total absence from
their works of creative power. These rhymers wrote for
the age, and illustrate it, but they did not write for all time,
and a small volume would suffice to hold all their verse
which is of permanent value. Too often they imagined that
by the composition of flowing couplets they proved their
title to rank with inspired poets. They confounded the art
of verse-making with the divine art of poetry, and were not
aware that the substance of their work is prose. Now and
then the digger in this mine will discover a small nugget
of gold, but for the most part the interest called forth by
the poets mentioned in the present chapter, is more historical
than poetical, and the reader in passing to the great
prose writers of the age will be conscious of gain rather
than of loss.</p>

<h3>JOSEPH ADDISON&mdash;SIR RICHARD STEELE.</h3>


<p>As essayists, the writings of Addison and of Steele are
familiar to all readers of eighteenth-century literature.
Their work in other departments may be neglected without
much loss; but the student who disregards the <i>Tatler</i>,
the <i>Spectator</i>, the <i>Guardian</i>, and some of the essay-volumes
which follow in their wake, will be blind to one of the
most significant literary features of the period.</p>

<p>The alliance between Addison and Steele was so intimate,
that to judge of one apart from the other, would be
fair to neither. It may be well, therefore, after giving the
leading facts in the lives of the two friends, to bring them
together again while considering the work they accomplished
in their literary partnership. One point, I think,
will come out clearly in this examination, namely, that
while Steele might, under very inferior conditions, have
produced the <i>Tatler</i> and <i>Spectator</i> without Addison,
it is highly improbable that Addison, as an essayist,
would have existed without Steele.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Joseph Addison
(1672-1719).</div>

<p>Addison lives on the reputation of his prose works,
but he thought that he was a poet, and
was regarded as a poet by his contemporaries.
It was by verse that he won his
earliest reputation, and it was on his Pegasus that he
rose to be Secretary of State. He was born on May 1st,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
1672, at Milston, in Wiltshire, a parish of which his
father was the rector, and was educated at the Charterhouse,
where he contracted his memorable friendship with
Steele. Thence, in 1687, at the boyish age of fifteen,
he went up to Queen's College, Oxford, and in a few
months, thanks to his Latin verses, gained a scholarship
at Magdalen, of which college ten years later he became
a fellow.</p>

<p>While at Oxford he acquired, after the fashion of the
day, what Johnson calls 'the trade of a courtier.' His
Latin poem on the <i>Peace of Ryswick</i> was dedicated to
Montague, and two years later a pension of £300 a year,
gained through Somers and Montague, enabled him to
travel, in order that by gaining a knowledge of French
and Italian, he might be fitted for the diplomatic service.
Some time after his return to England he published his
<i>Remarks on Several Parts of Italy</i> (1705), and dedicated the
volume to Swift, 'the most agreeable companion, the truest
friend, and the greatest genius of his age.'</p>

<p>Addison's patrons had now lost their power, and he was
left to his own exertions. His difficulties did not last long.
In 1704 the battle of Blenheim called forth several weak
efforts from the poetasters, and as the Government
required verse more worthy of the occasion, the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, on the recommendation of Montague,
now Earl of Halifax, applied to Addison, who, in answer
to the appeal, published <i>The Campaign</i>, in 1705. The
poem contains the well-known similitude of the angel,
and also an apt allusion to the great storm that had lately
destroyed fleets and devastated the country.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'So when an angel by divine command<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rising tempests shakes a guilty land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as of late o'er pale Britannia past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calm and serene he drives the furious blast;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, pleased the Almighty's orders to perform,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>The Campaign</i>, which has no other passage worth
quoting, proved a happy hit, and was of such service to
the Ministry, that Addison found the way to fame and
fortune. He was appointed Commissioner of Appeals,
and not long after Under Secretary of State. In 1707 he
accompanied his friend and patron, Halifax, on a mission
to Hanover, and two years later he was appointed Chief
Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. In Dublin
he gained golden opinions. 'I am convinced,' Swift
writes, 'that whatever Government come over, you will
find all marks of kindness from any parliament here with
respect to your employment; the Tories contending with
the Whigs which should speak best of you. In short, if
you will come over again when you are at leisure, we will
raise an army and make you king of Ireland.' When the
Whig Ministry fell in 1710, and Addison lost his appointment,
he must have gained a fortune, for he was able to
purchase an estate for £10,000.</p>

<p>In the early years of the century the Italian opera,
which had been brought into England in the reign of
William and Mary, excited the mirth and opposition of the
wits. Lord Chesterfield, who called it 'too absurd and extravagant
to mention,' said, 'Whenever I go to the opera
I leave my sense and reason at the door with my half-guinea,
and deliver myself up to my eyes and ears.'
Steele, Gay, and Pope ridiculed the new-fangled entertainment,
and Colley Cibber, too, pointed his jest at these
'poetical drams, these gin-shops of the stage that intoxicate
its auditors, and dishonour their understanding with
a levity for which I want a name.' Addison, who has
some lively papers on the subject in the <i>Spectator</i>, undertook
to give a faithful account of the progress of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Italian opera on the English stage, 'for there is no question,'
he writes, 'but our great grandchildren will be very
curious to know why their forefathers used to sit together
like an audience of foreigners in their own country; and to
hear whole plays acted before them in a tongue which
they did not understand.'</p>

<p>Before writing thus in the <i>Spectator</i>, Addison, in order
to oppose the Italian opera, by what he regarded as a
more rational pastime, produced his English opera of
<i>Rosamond</i>, which was acted in 1706, and proved a failure
on the stage. The music is said to have been bad, and the
poetry is the work of a writer destitute of lyrical genius.
Lord Macaulay, who finds a merit in almost everything
produced by Addison, praises 'the smoothness with which
the verses glide, and the elasticity with which they
bound,' and considers that if he 'had left heroic couplets
to Pope, and blank verse to Rowe, and had employed himself
in writing airy and spirited songs, his reputation as a
poet would have stood far higher than it now does.' The
gliding movement of the verse may be admitted; but lyric
poetry demands the higher qualities of music and imaginative
treatment, and Addison's 'smoothness,' so far from
being a poetical gift, is a mechanical acquisition.</p>

<p>In 1713 his <i>Cato</i>, with its stately rhetoric and cold
dignity, received a very different reception. The prologue,
written by Pope, is in admirable accordance with the spirit
of the play. Addison's purpose is to exhibit a great man
struggling with adversity, and Pope writes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'He bids your breasts with ancient ardour rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And calls forth Roman drops from British eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Virtue confessed in human shape he draws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What Plato thought, and God-like Cato was:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No common object to your sight displays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what with pleasure Heaven itself surveys;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A brave man struggling in the storms of fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And greatly falling with a falling state!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Cato gives his little senate laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What bosom beats not in his country's cause?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Addison has proved that he could draw a life-like character
in his representation of Sir Roger de Coverley, but
the <i>dramatis personæ</i>, who act a part, or are supposed to
act one, in <i>Cato</i>, are mere dummies, made to express fine
sentiments. There is no flesh and blood in them, and
owing to the dramatist's regard for unity of place, the play
is full of absurdities. Yet <i>Cato</i> was received with immense
applause. It was regarded from a political aspect, and
both Whig and Tory strove to turn the drama to party
account. 'The numerous and violent claps of the Whig
party,' Pope writes, 'on the one side of the theatre, were
echoed back by the Tories on the other; while the author
sweated behind the scenes with concern to find their
applause proceeding more from the hand than the head.'</p>

<p>In another letter he says: 'The town is so fond of it,
that the orange wenches and fruit women in the parks
offer the books at the side of the coaches, and the prologue
and epilogue are cried about the streets by the common
hawkers.' It would be interesting to ascertain what
there was in the state of public affairs in the spring of
1713, which created this enthusiasm. Swift, writing to
Stella, alludes to a rehearsal of the play, but makes no
criticism upon it; and Berkeley, who was in London at
the time, and had a seat in Addison's box on the first night,
is also silent about it. In a letter written, as it happens,
by Bolingbroke, on the day that <i>Cato</i> was produced, he
indicates the signs of the time, as they appeared to a Tory
statesman: 'The prospect before us,' he writes, 'is dark
and melancholy. What will happen no man is able to
foretell.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>It was this sense of doubt and insecurity in the nation
that gave significance to trifles. The political atmosphere
was charged with electricity. The Tories, though in office,
were far from feeling themselves secure, and both Harley
and Bolingbroke were in correspondence with the Pretender.
Atterbury, who was heart and soul with him, had
just been made a bishop, Protestant ascendancy was in
danger, the security of the country seemed to hang on the
frail life of the Queen, and the strong party spirit of the
time was easily fanned into a flame. We cannot now
place ourselves in the position of the spectators whose
passions gave such popularity to <i>Cato</i>. Its mild platitudes
and rhetorical periods, its coldness and sobriety, seem ill
fitted to arouse the fervour of playgoers, but Addison,
whose good luck rarely failed him, was especially fortunate
in the moment chosen for the representation of the play.
Had <i>Cato</i> exhibited genius of the highest order, it could
not have been more successful. Cibber writes that it
was acted in London five times a week for a month to constantly
crowded houses, and when the tragedy was acted
at Oxford, 'Our house,' he says, 'was in a manner invested,
and entrance demanded by twelve o'clock at noon,
and before one it was not wide enough for many who came
too late for places.'<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p><i>Cato</i> had the good fortune to run in London for thirty-five
nights, and gained also some reputation on the continent.
It is formed on the French model, and Addison was therefore
praised by Voltaire as 'the first English writer who
composed a regular tragedy.' He added that <i>Cato</i> was
'a masterpiece.' If so, it is one of the masterpieces that
has long ceased to be read. Little could its author have
surmised that his tragedy, received with universal praise,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
had but a brief life to live, while the Essays which he had
already contributed to the <i>Tatler</i> and <i>Spectator</i> would make
his name familiar to future generations.</p>

<p>Addison's poetry may now be regarded as extinct, and
most of the poems he wrote are probably unknown to the
present generation of readers even by name. His Latin
verses are pronounced excellent by all competent critics,
but when a man writes verses in a dead language he does
so generally to show his scholarship, and not to express his
inspiration. Latin verse is, as M. Taine says, a faded
flower. Now and then, indeed, a poem has been written
with merits apart from its latinity&mdash;witness the <i>Epitaphium
Damonis</i> of Milton&mdash;but Addison, who lacked poetic fire in
his native language, was not likely to find it in a dead tongue.
His English poems are generally dull, and sometimes, as
in his earliest poem, the <i>Account of the greatest English
Poets</i> (1694), the tameness of the verse is matched by the
ignorance of the criticism. The student will observe how
differently the theme is treated by a true poet like Drayton
in his <i>Epistle to Reynolds</i>; or, like Ben Jonson, in the
many allusions that he makes to his country's poets. Compare,
too, Addison's <i>Letter from Italy</i> (1701) with the
lovely lines on a like theme in Goldsmith's <i>Traveller</i>, and
the contrast between a verseman and a poet is at once
apparent. Addison, it may be added, is remembered for
his hymns, which may be found in most selections of
sacred verse, and deserve a place in the best of them. As
the forerunner of Isaac Watts (1674-1748) and of Charles
Wesley (1708-1788), he struck upon what at that time
might, in our country, be almost called a new department
of literature; and it is remarkable that an age which so
dreaded enthusiasm should have originated verse which
gives utterance to the most emotional form of spiritual
aspiration. As hymn-writers, Englishmen were more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
a century behind the best sacred poets of Germany.
Luther had taught the German people the power of
hymnody, but it was during the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648),
and after its conclusion, that the spirit of devotion
found full expression in religious verse. Just before the
engagement at Leipzic, Gustavus Adolphus wrote his well-known
battle hymn, and the peace was celebrated in a
noble hymn by Martin Rinkart. He was followed by a
succession of sacred singers whose devout utterances influenced
and in some degree inspired the Wesleys.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A verse may find him whom a sermon flies,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>says George Herbert, and the enormous power wielded
by Methodism owes a large portion of its strength to
song.</p>

<p>Amidst much in their writings that is questionable in
taste and weak in expression, both Watts and Charles
Wesley have written hymns which prove their incontestible
right to a place among the poets, and the influence
they have exerted over the English-speaking race is beyond
the power of the literary historian to estimate. The external
divisions of the Christian Church are numerous; its
unity is to be seen in the Hymn Book. 'Men whose theological
views contrast most strongly,' says Mr. Abbey in
his essay on <i>The English Sacred Poetry of the Eighteenth
Century</i>, 'meet on common ground when they express in
verse the deeper aspirations of the heart and the voice of
Christian praise.'</p>

<p>In 1714, on the death of the Queen, Addison was once
more in office, and held his old position of Irish Secretary.
In the following year he defended the Whig Government
and Whig principles in the <i>Freeholder</i>, a paper published
twice weekly. In it he gives no niggard praise to the
Government of George I., and to the King himself, for his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
'civil virtues,' and for his martial achievements. Addison's
praise disagrees, it need scarcely be said, with the more
minute and veracious description of the King given by
Thackeray, but a party politician in those days could
scarcely be a faithful chronicler. He could see what he
wished to see, but found it necessary to shut his eyes when
the prospect became unpleasant. George was a heartless
libertine, but Addison observes with great satisfaction that
the women most eminent for virtue and good sense are in
his interest. 'It would be no small misfortune,' he says,
'to a sovereign, though he had all the male part of the
nation on his side, if he did not find himself king of the
most beautiful half of his subjects. Ladies are always
of great use to the party they espouse, and never fail
to win over numbers to it. Lovers, according to Sir
William Petty's computation, make at least the third
part of the sensible men of the British nation, and it
has been an uncontroverted maxim in all ages, that though
a husband is sometimes a stubborn sort of a creature, a
lover is always at the devotion of his mistress. By this
means it lies in the power of every fine woman to secure at
least half-a-dozen able-bodied men to his Majesty's service.
The female world are likewise indispensably necessary in
the best causes to manage the controversial part of them, in
which no man of tolerable breeding is ever able to refute
them. Arguments out of a pretty mouth are unanswerable.'</p>

<p>The essayist thinks it fortunate for the Whigs 'that
their very enemies acknowledge the finest women of Great
Britain to be of that party;' and in an amusing but rather
absurd way he discourses to maids, wives, and widows on
the advantages of adhering to the Hanoverian Government.
It is characteristic of Addison that a political paper like
the <i>Freeholder</i> should be flavoured with the humour and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
badinage he found so effective in the <i>Spectator</i>. To the
ladies he appeals again and again, but not to their reason.
He gives them mirth instead of argument, and thinks it
more likely to prevail with the 'Fair Sex.' The <i>Freeholder</i>
has several papers worthy of the author in his best moods,
the best of them, perhaps, being the 'Tory Fox-hunter,'
with which, to quote Johnson's words, 'bigotry itself must
be delighted.' In the year which gave birth to the <i>Freeholder</i>,
<i>The Drummer</i>, a comedy, was acted at Drury Lane,
and ran three nights. The play was not acknowledged
by Addison, neither was it printed in Tickell's edition of
his works; but Steele, who published an edition of the
play, with a dedication to Congreve, never doubted, and
there is no reason to doubt, that Addison was the
author. 'The piece,' Mr. Courthope writes, 'is like <i>Cato</i>,
a standing proof of Addison's deficiency in dramatic
genius. The plot is poor and trivial, nor does the dialogue,
though it shows in many passages traces of its author's
peculiar vein of humour, make amends by its brilliancy
for the tameness of the dramatic situation.'<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>After the <i>Freeholder</i> Addison wrote nothing of importance,
unless we except the essay published after his death
<i>On the Evidences of Christianity</i>. Of this essay it will
suffice to quote the judgment of his most distinguished
eulogist. After observing that the treatise shows the
narrow limits of Addison's classical knowledge, Lord
Macaulay adds: 'It is melancholy to see how helplessly
he gropes his way from blunder to blunder. He assigns
as grounds for his religious belief stories as absurd as that
of the Cock Lane Ghost, and forgeries as rank as Ireland's
Vortigern; puts faith in the lie about the Thundering
Legion; is convinced that Tiberius moved the senate to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
admit Jesus among the gods, and pronounces the letter of
Agbarus, King of Edessa, to be a record of great authority.
Nor were these errors the effects of superstition, for to
superstition Addison was by no means prone. The truth
is, that he was writing about what he did not understand.'</p>

<p>In 1716, after having been made one of the Commissioners
for Trades and Colonies, he married the Countess
Dowager of Warwick, with whom he had been acquainted
for some years. The marriage, according to the doubtful
authority of Pope, was not a happy one, and is said to
have driven Addison to the consolations of the tavern.
He did not need them long. In 1717 Sunderland became
Prime Minister, and made Addison a Secretary of State,
an appointment which he resigned eleven months afterwards;
and in 1719 he died at Holland House at the age of forty-seven,
leaving one daughter as the memorial of the union.
He lies, as is fitting, in the great Abbey of which he has
written so beautifully.</p>

<p>Tickell's noble tribute to his friend's memory belongs
to the undying poetry which neither age nor fresher forms
of verse can render obsolete. It must suffice to quote here
a few lines from a poem which, despite some conventional
expressions common to the time, is worthy of its theme
throughout:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'If pensive to the rural shades I rove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His shape o'ertakes me in the lonely grove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas there of Just and Good he reasoned strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cleared some great truth, or raised some serious song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There patient showed us the wise course to steer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A candid censor, and a friend severe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There taught us how to live; and (oh! too high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The price for knowledge) taught us how to die.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There are few men of literary eminence in the eighteenth
century of whom we know so little as of Addison. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
own <i>Spectator</i>, who never opened his lips but in his club,
is scarcely more silent than the essayist's biographers, so
trifling are the details they have to record beyond the
bare facts of his official and literary career. Steele knew
him better, and, in spite of an unhappy estrangement at
the last, probably loved him more than anyone else, and
had he written his story, as he once proposed doing, the
narrative might have been charming; but, alas for Steele's
resolutions!</p>

<p>That Addison was a shy man we know&mdash;Lord Chesterfield
said he was the most timid man he ever knew&mdash;and
it speaks well for his resolution and strength of purpose
that he should have risen notwithstanding this timidity
to so high a position in public affairs. His want of oratorical
power was a drawback to his efficiency, and Sir
James Macintosh was probably right in saying that
Addison as Dean of St. Patrick's, and Swift as Secretary
of State, would have been a happy stroke of fortune,
putting each into the place most fitted for him. The
essayist's reserve, while it closed his lips in general
society, did not prevent him from being one of the most
fascinating of companions in the freedom of conversation
with a few intimate friends. Swift, Steele, and even
Pope, testify to Addison's irresistible charm in the select
society that he loved. Young said he could chain the
attention of every hearer, and Lady Mary Montagu declared
that he was the best company in the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard Steele
(1672-1729).</div>

<p>Richard Steele was born in Dublin, 1672, of English
parents, and educated at the Charterhouse,
where, as we have said, Addison was at the
same time a pupil. In 1690 he matriculated
at Christ Church, Oxford, Addison being then demy at
Magdalen. Steele left college without taking a degree,
and entered the army as a cadet. After a time he ob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>tained
the rank of captain in Lord Lucas's fusiliers, and
wrote his treatise, <i>The Christian Hero</i> (1701), with the
design, he says, 'principally to fix upon his own mind a
strong impression of virtue and religion in opposition to
a stronger propensity towards unwarrantable pleasure.'
Steele was an honest lover of the things most worthy of
love, but his frailty too often proved stronger than his
virtue, and the purpose of <i>The Christian Hero</i> was not
answered.</p>

<p>Jeremy Collier's <i>Short View of the Immorality and Profanity
of the English Stage</i>, published in 1698, had made,
as it well might, a powerful impression, and Steele, who
was always ready to inculcate morality on other people,
wrote four comedies with a moral purpose. <i>The Funeral;
or Grief à-la-Mode</i> was acted with success at Drury Lane
in 1701, and when published passed through several
editions. <i>The Lying Lover</i> followed two years later,
and was, in the comfortable judgment of the author,
'damned for its piety.' This was followed, in 1705, by
<i>The Tender Husband</i>, a play suggested by the <i>Sicilien</i>
of Molière, as <i>The Lying Lover</i> had been founded on the
<i>Menteur</i> of Corneille. Many years later Steele's last play,
<i>The Conscious Lovers</i> (1722), completed his performances
as a dramatist. It was dedicated to the King, who is said
to have sent the author £500. The modern reader will
find little worthy of attention in the dramas of Steele.
His sense of humour enlivens some of the scenes, and is,
perhaps, chiefly visible in <i>The Funeral</i>; but for the most
part dulness is in the ascendant, and the sentiment is
frequently mawkish. <i>The Conscious Lovers</i>, said Parson
Adams, contains 'some things almost solemn enough for
a sermon.' This may be true, but we do not desire a
sermon in a play, and Steele, who is always a lively
essayist, loses his liveliness in writing for the stage. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
has been observed by Mr. Ward that, taking a hint from
Colley Cibber, he 'became the real founder of that sentimental
comedy which exercised so pernicious an influence
upon the progress of our dramatic literature.' 'It would
be unjust,' he adds, 'to hold him responsible for the
feebleness of successors who were altogether deficient in
the comic power which he undoubtedly even as a dramatist
exhibits; but in so far as their aberrations were the result
of his example, he must be held to have contributed,
though with the best of motives, to the decline of the
English drama.'<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> One of the prominent offenders who
followed in Steele's wake was George Lillo (1693-1739),
whose highly moral tragedies, written for the edification
of playgoers, have the kind of tragic interest which is
called forth by any commonplace tale of crime and
misery. In Lillo's two most important dramas, <i>George
Barnwell</i> (1731), a play founded on the old ballad, and
<i>The Fatal Curiosity</i> (1736), there is a total absence of the
elevation in character and language which gives dignity to
tragedy. His plays are like tales of guilt arranged and
amplified from the Newgate Calendar. The author wrote
with a good purpose, and the public appreciated his work,
but it is not dramatic art, and has no pretension to the
name of literature.</p>

<p>Throughout his life Steele was at war with fortune.
His hopefulness was inexhaustible, but he learnt no lessons
from experience, and escaped from one slough to fall into
another. He was as unthrifty as Goldsmith, whom in
many respects he resembles, and his warm, impulsive
nature was allied to a combativeness and jealousy which
sometimes led him to quarrel with his best friends. Of
his passion for the somewhat exacting lady whom he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
married,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and of the 400 and odd notelets addressed by
the lover-husband to his 'dear, dearest Prue,' and 'absolute
Governess,' it is enough to say here, that the story
told offhand in his own words, shows how lovable the man
was in spite of the faults which he never attempted to
conceal. Only about a week before the marriage the
lady had fair warning of one probable drawback to her
happiness as a wife.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> On the morning of August 30th,
1707, Steele advised his 'fair one' to look up to that
heaven which had made her so sweet a companion, and in
the evening of that day he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p style="margin-left:2em;">'<span class="smcap">Dear lovely Mrs. Scurlock</span>,</p>

<p>'I have been in very good company, where your
health, under the character of <i>the woman I loved best</i>, has
been often drunk, so that I may say I am dead drunk for
your sake, which is more than I <i>die for you</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-right:2em;text-align:right;">'<span class="smcap">Rich. Steele</span>.'</p>
</div>

<p>After marriage Steele's extravagance and impecuniosity
must have proved a severe trial to Prue. At times he
would live in considerable style, and Berkeley, who writes,
in 1713, of dining with him frequently at his house in
Bloomsbury Square, praises his table, servants, and coach
as 'very genteel.' At other times the family were without
common necessaries, and on one occasion there was not 'an
inch of candle, a pound of coal, or a bit of meat in the
house.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p><p>On the 12th April, 1709, Steele issued the first number
of the <i>Tatler</i>, its supposed author being the Isaac Bickerstaff,
whose name, thanks to Swift, had been 'rendered
famous through all parts of Europe.' The essays appeared
every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, for the convenience
of the post, and at the outset contained political
news, which Steele, by his government appointment of
Gazetteer, was enabled to supply. After awhile, however,
much to the advantage of the <i>Tatler</i>, this news was
dropped. The articles are dated from White's Chocolate-house,
from Will's Coffee-house, from the Grecian, and
from the St. James's. It is probable that the column in
Defoe's <i>Review</i>, containing <i>Advice from the Scandal Club</i>,
suggested his 'Lucubrations' to Steele. If so, it does not
detract from his originality of treatment, for Defoe's town
gossip is poor stuff. Addison, who knew nothing of the
project beforehand, came, ere long, to his friend's assistance;
but it was not until about eighty numbers had
appeared, that he became a frequent contributor, and
before that time Steele had made his mark. When the
essays were afterwards reprinted in four volumes, Steele,
who was never wanting in gratitude, generously acknowledged
the help he had received. 'I fared,' he says,
'like a distressed prince who calls in a powerful neighbour
to his aid. I was undone by my auxiliary. When I had
once called him in, I could not subsist without dependence
on him.' The <i>Tatler</i> still supplies delightful
entertainment, and in the almost total absence of amusing
and wholesome reading in Steele's time, must have proved
a welcome companion. Readers who are inundated by
what is called 'light literature' can with difficulty
imagine the dearth suffered in Pope's day, when the interminable
romances of Calprenède, of Mdlle. de Scuderi
and her brother, and of Madame la Fayette, were the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
liveliest books considered fit for a modest woman to read.
A novel, however, in ten volumes, like the <i>Grand Cyrus</i>
or <i>Clélie</i>, had one advantage over the cheap fictions of
our time, its interest was not soon exhausted.</p>

<p>The <i>Tatler</i> has claims upon the student's attention,
apart from the entertainment it affords. Steele, who lived
from hand to mouth, and wrote, as he lived, on the impulse
of the moment, had unwittingly begun a work
destined to form an epoch in English literature. The
<i>Essay</i>, as we now understand the word, dates from the
<i>Lucubrations of Isaac Bickerstaff</i>, and Steele and Addison,
who may boast a numerous progeny, have in Charles
Lamb the noblest of their sons.</p>

<p>On the 2nd January, 1711, Steele wrote the final number
of the <i>Tatler</i>, partly on the plea that the essays would
suffice to make four volumes, and partly because he was
known to be the author, and could not, as Mr. Steele,
attack vices with the freedom of Mr. Bickerstaff. Addison,
who had done so much to assist Steele in his first venture,
was as ignorant of his intention to close the work as he
was of its initiation. Two months later <i>The Spectator</i>
appeared, and this time the friends worked in concert. It
proved a brilliantly successful partnership. The second
number, in which the characters of the club are introduced,
was written by Steele, and to him we owe the first
sketch of the immortal Sir Roger de Coverley:</p>

<p>'When he is in town he lives in Soho Square. It is
said he keeps himself a bachelor by reason he was crossed
in love by a perverse, beautiful widow of the next county
to him. Before his disappointment, Sir Roger was what
you call a fine gentleman, had often supped with my Lord
Rochester and Sir George Etheridge, fought a duel upon
his first coming to town, and kicked bully Dawson in a
public coffee-house for calling him youngster. But being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
ill-used by the above-mentioned widow, he was very
serious for a year and a half; and though, his temper
being naturally jovial, he at last got over it, he grew careless
of himself, and never dressed afterwards. He continues
to wear a coat and doublet of the same cut that
were in fashion at the time of his repulse, which, in his
merry humours, he tells us has been in and out twelve
times since he first wore it.... He is now in his fifty-sixth
year, cheerful, gay, and hearty, keeps a good house
both in town and country; a great lover of mankind; but
there is such a mirthful cast in his behaviour, that he is
rather beloved than esteemed. His tenants grow rich, his
servants look satisfied, all the young women profess love
to him, and the young men are glad of his company.
When he comes into a house he calls the servants by their
names, and talks all the way upstairs to a visit. I must
not omit that Sir Roger is a justice of the quorum; that
he fills the chair at a quarter-session with great abilities;
and three months ago gained universal applause by explaining
a passage in the Game Act.'</p>

<p>In their daily issue, as well as afterwards in volumes,
the essays had an extensive sale. They were to be found
on every breakfast-table, and so popular did they prove,
that when the imposition of a halfpenny tax destroyed a
number of periodicals, Steele found it safe to double the
price of the <i>Spectator</i>. The vivacity and humour of the
paper were visible from the beginning. 'Mr. Steele,' Swift
wrote, 'seems to have gathered new life, and to have a new
fund of wit.' Of 555 papers, Addison wrote 274 and
Steele 236, while the remaining forty-five were the work
of occasional contributors. In the full tide of its success,
and without any assigned reason, the <i>Spectator</i> was
brought to a conclusion in December, 1712, and in the following
spring Steele started the <i>Guardian</i>, which might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
have been as fortunate as its predecessor, had not the
editor's zeal tempted him to diverge to politics. He
had also a disagreement with his publisher, and the
<i>Guardian</i> was allowed but a short life of 175 numbers.
Of these about fifty were due to Addison, and upwards of
eighty to Steele.</p>

<p>Steele's political ardour was irrepressible, and a paper in
the <i>Guardian</i> (No. 128), demanding the abolition of Dunkirk,
called forth a pamphlet from Swift, in which the
weaknesses of his former friend are sneered at and denounced
with enough of truthfulness to enhance their
malice. After allowing that Steele has humour, and is no
disagreeable companion 'after the first bottle,' Swift adds,
'Being the most imprudent man alive, he never follows the
advice of his friends, but is wholly at the mercy of fools
and knaves, or hurried away by his own caprice, by which
he has committed more absurdities in economy, friendship,
love, duty, good manners, politics, religion, and writing
than ever fell to one man's share.' A little later, in
anticipation of the Queen's death, Steele published <i>The
Crisis</i> (1714), a political pamphlet, which led to his expulsion
from the House of Commons. It was answered
by one of the most masterly of Swift's pamphlets, <i>The
Public Spirit of the Whigs</i>, in which it is suggested that
Steele might be superior to other writers on the Whig side
'provided he would a little regard the propriety and disposition
of his words, consult the grammatical part, and get
some information in the subject he intends to handle.'</p>

<p>The reader is chiefly concerned with Steele as an essayist,
and it is unnecessary to follow his career in the House of
Commons and out of it. Yet there is one anecdote too
characteristic to be omitted in the briefest notice of his
life. Lady Charlotte Finch had been attacked in the
<i>Examiner</i> 'for knotting in St. James's Chapel during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
divine service, in the immediate presence both of God and
her Majesty, who were affronted together.' Steele denounced
the calumny in the <i>Guardian</i>. Upon taking his
seat as member for Stockbridge, he was attacked by the
Tories on account of <i>The Crisis</i>, which they deemed an inflammatory
libel, and defended himself in a speech which
occupied three hours. When he left the House, Lord Finch,
who, like Steele, was a new member, rose to make his maiden
speech in defence of the man who had defended his sister;
a nervous feeling caused him to hesitate, and he sat down,
exclaiming, 'It is strange I cannot speak for this man,
though I could readily fight for him.' The House cheered
these generous words, and Lord Finch rising again, made
an able speech. The effort was a vain one, and Steele
lost his seat. A few months later, after the death of
Queen Anne, he entered the House again as member for
Boroughbridge, and having been placed in the commission
of peace for Middlesex, on presenting an address from the
county, he received the honour of knighthood.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had not renounced his vocation of essayist.
The <i>Guardian</i> was followed by the <i>Englishman</i> (1713),
the <i>Englishman</i> by the <i>Lover</i> (1714), and the <i>Lover</i> by the
<i>Reader</i> (1714), a journal strongly political in character.
Of this only nine numbers were issued. Then came <i>Town
Talk</i>, the <i>Tea Table</i>, <i>Chit-chat</i>, and the <i>Theatre</i>. Sir Richard
appears to have been always in a hurry to break new
ground, a foible not confined to literature. He was continually
starting new projects, and never doubted, in spite
of numberless failures, that his latest effort to make a
fortune would be successful.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his appointments as manager of Drury
Lane and as a Commissioner in Scotland to inquire into the
Estates of Traitors, Steele's money difficulties did not lessen
as he advanced in life; worse still, he had the misfortune to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
quarrel with his oldest and dearest friend. For this he and
Addison were alike to blame, and Addison dying a few months
later, there was no time for reconciliation. In 1718 Steele
had lost his wife, and some years afterwards his only remaining
son. Ultimately, broken in health and fortune, Sir
Richard retired to Carmarthen, and there, in 1729, he died.</p>

<p>'I was told,' says Victor, 'he retained his cheerful sweetness
of temper to the last; and would often be carried out
in a summer's evening, when the country lads and lasses
were assembled at their rural sports, and with his pencil
give an order on his agent, the mercer, for a new gown to
the best dancer.'<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>All literature worthy of the name is the expression of the
writer's life, of his aspirations, and of his ultimate aims;
and since man is a moral being, it cannot be severed from
morality. To point a moral, if it be within the scope of
imaginative art, is subordinate to its main purpose. To
delight by stimulating the imagination, to give a new
beauty to existence by widening the realm of thought,&mdash;these
are some of the noblest purposes of literature;
and while men and women of creative genius are among
our wisest teachers, the wisdom we gain from them
comes to us without direct enforcement. In the last century,
however, authors of good character, and authors who
had no character to boast of, were equally impressed with
the necessity of adorning their pages with moral maxims,
and if this moral was not inserted in the body of the
work, it was inevitable that it should be tacked on to the
end of it like a tail to a kite. Steele in his artless way had
a moral end in view, though his method of reaching it was
not always wise or even discreet. Addison had his moral
also. It pervades everything he wrote, but so artfully does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
he make use of it, that the reader is not unpleasantly conscious
of a purpose. His allegories belong to an obsolete
form of literature, but one of them at least <i>The Vision of
Mirza</i>, may be still read with pleasure. His Saturday
essays, which are nearly always serious in character, are
the sermons of a layman, expressed in the most lucid
style and in the purest English. His tales, like his allegories,
have lost much of their flavour, but the humorous
essays, in which he depicts the manners of the time, as
well as the numbers devoted to the Spectator Club and to
Addison's beloved Sir Roger, have a perennial charm.
There is a felicity in the essayist's touch which is beyond
imitation, although a reader might give, as Johnson suggested,
days and nights to the study. The style is the
man, and to write as Addison wrote it would be necessary
to reach his moral and intellectual level, to see with his
shrewd but kindly eyes, and to have his fine sense of
humour. His faults, too, must be shared by his imitator&mdash;the
somewhat too delicate refinement of a nature that
never yields to impulse&mdash;the feminine sensitiveness that is
allied to jealousy. Addison, in the judgment of his admirers,
comes very near to perfection, and that is an irritating
quality in a fellow mortal. It is, if it be not paradoxical
to say so, the defect of his essays. There is nothing
definite to find fault with in them, but we feel that strength
is wanting. The clear and silent stream is a beautiful object,
but after awhile it becomes monotonous, and we long for
the swift and impetuous movement of a mountain torrent.
It would be a thankless task, however, to dwell insistently
on the deficiencies of a writer who has done so much for literature,
and so much, too, for what is better than literature.
We may wish that he had more warmth in him, somewhat
more of energy and passion, yet such merits would be
scarcely consonant with the graceful charm which gives to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the prose writings of Addison an unrivalled position in
Pope's age, and, it might be added, in the eighteenth century,
were it not for the priceless literary gift bestowed
upon Oliver Goldsmith.</p>

<p>Steele's fame as a writer has been overshadowed by the
more exquisite genius of Addison, and his reputation has
suffered partly from his own frailties and partly from the
contemptuous way in which he has been treated by the
panegyrists and critics of Addison. Pity is closely allied
to contempt, and Sir Richard has come to be regarded as
a scapegrace whose chief honour in life was the friendship
of the accomplished essayist. Yet it was Steele who
created the form of literature in which Addison earned his
laurels, and without which he would in the present day be
utterly forgotten. Steele was the discoverer of a new
country, and if Addison took possession of its fairest portion,
it was after his friend had pointed out the path and
made the way easy. It would be very unjust, however, to
treat of Steele solely as a pioneer. His own work, though
less perfect than that of Addison, a consummate master
of composition, is rich in variety and spirit, in pathos and
in knowledge of the world. Steele is often careless, but
he is never dull, and writes with a glow of enthusiasm
that excites the reader's sympathy. Truly does Mr. Dobson
say that while Addison's essays are faultless in their art
and beyond the range of his friend's more impulsive
nature, 'for words which the heart finds when the head is
seeking; for phrases glowing with the white heat of a
generous emotion; for sentences which throb and tingle
with manly pity or courageous indignation, we must go to
the essays of Steele.'<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Sir Richard's pathetic touches and artless turns of ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>pression
come from the heart. He is the most natural of
writers, but does not seem to be aware that nature, in
order to be converted into good literature, needs a little
clothing. His essays have often a looseness or negligence
of aim unpardonable in a man who can write so well. A
conspicuous illustration of this defect may be seen in
No. 181 of the <i>Tatler</i>, one of the most beautiful pieces
from Steele's pen.</p>

<p>'The first sense of sorrow,' he writes, 'I ever knew was
upon the death of my father, at which time I was not
quite five years of age; but was rather amazed at what all
the house meant, than possessed with a real understanding
why nobody was willing to play with me. I remember I
went into the room where his body lay, and my mother
sat weeping alone by it. I had my battledore in my hand,
and fell a-beating the coffin and calling "Papa," for, I
know not how, I had some slight idea that he was locked
up there. My mother catched me in her arms, and transported
beyond all patience of the silent grief she was
before in, she almost smothered me in her embraces; and
told me in a flood of tears, "Papa could not hear me, and
would play with me no more, for they were going to put
him under ground, whence he could never come to us again."
She was a very beautiful woman of a noble spirit, and
there was a dignity in her grief amidst all the wildness of
her transport, which, methought, struck me with an instinct
of sorrow, that before I was sensible of what it was
to grieve, seized my very soul, and has made pity the
weakness of my heart ever since.'</p>

<p>Later on in the essay, and still looking back on the past,
Steele recalls the untimely death of the first object his
eyes ever beheld with love, and then abruptly dismissing
his regrets he carelessly finishes the paper with this characteristic
passage: 'A large train of disasters were coming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
on to my memory when my servant knocked at my closet
door, and interrupted me with a letter, attended with a
hamper of wine of the same sort with that which is to be
put to sale on Thursday next at Garraway's Coffee-house.
Upon the receipt of it I sent for three of my friends. We
are so intimate that we can be company in whatever state
of mind we meet, and can entertain each other without
expecting always to rejoice. The wine we found to be
generous and warming, but with such a heat as moved us
rather to be cheerful than frolicsome. It revived the spirits,
without firing the blood. We commended it until two
of the clock this morning, and having to-day met a little
before dinner, we found that though we drank two bottles
a man, we had much more reason to recollect than forget
what had passed the night before.'</p>

<p>Steele, to quote Johnson's phrase, was 'the most agreeable
rake that ever trod the rounds of indulgence,' but he
had many a fine quality that does not harmonize with the
character of a rake; and although he hurt himself by his
follies, he did his best to help others by his genial wisdom.
If he did not sufficiently regard his own interests, his
thoughts, as Addison said, 'teemed with projects for his
country's good.' Savage Landor, with an impulse of
somewhat extravagant eulogy, exclaimed, 'What a good
critic Steele was! I doubt if he has ever been surpassed.'
This is one of the sayings that will not bear examination.
Steele had doubtless the fine perception of what is
noble in art and literature, which some men possess instinctively.
He felt what was good, but does not appear
either to have reached or strengthened his conclusions by
any process of study.</p>

<p>As an essayist Steele is careless, rapid, emotional, and
disposed to be on the best terms with himself and with his
readers. He makes them sure that if they could have met<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
him in his rollicking mood at Will's Coffee-house, he would
have treated them all round, even if, like Goldsmith, he
had been forced to borrow the money to do it. But he
was not always in this reckless humour. His heart was
expansive in its sympathies and tender as a woman's; his
mind was open to all kindly influences, and his essays
have in them the rich blood and vivid utterances of a man
who has 'warmed both hands before the fire of life.'</p>

<p>Between Steele's <i>Guardian</i> (1713) and the <i>Rambler</i> of
Johnson (1750), a period of thirty-seven years, a swarm
of periodicals testify to the fame of Steele and Addison.
The reader curious on the subject will find in Dr. Drake's
essays a minute account of the numerous essayists who
flourished, or who made an effort to live, between the
close of the eighth volume of the <i>Spectator</i> and the beginning
of the present century. Of these a few have still
a place on our shelves, but for the most part they enjoyed
a butterfly existence, and serve but to prove the immeasurable
superiority of the writers who created the English
Essay.</p>

<h3>JONATHAN SWIFT&mdash;JOHN ARBUTHNOT.</h3>


<p>The booksellers who employed the most famous man of
letters then living (1777), to write the <i>Lives of the Poets</i>,
selected the authors whose biographies were to accompany
the poems they proposed to publish. They did not know
the difference between versemakers and poets; but they
probably did know what authors of the rhyming tribe
were likely to prove the most popular. Dr. Johnson,
who was then in his sixty-ninth year, was willing to
write the <i>Lives</i> to order. He added, indeed, three or four
names to the list which had been given him; but he made
no protest, and contented himself, as he told Boswell, in
saying that a man was a dunce when he thought that he
was one.</p>

<p>Among the biographies included by Johnson in the
<i>Lives</i>, appears the illustrious name of Swift. He was far
indeed from being a dunce; but just as certainly he was
not a poet, unless the title be given to him by courtesy. On
the other hand, Swift ranks among the most distinguished
prose writers of his time&mdash;many critics consider him the
greatest&mdash;and he therefore finds his natural place in the
prose section of this volume.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jonathan Swift
(1667-1745).</div>

<p>Swift's life is an extraordinary psychological study, but
it will suffice to state here the bare outline
of his career. He was a posthumous child,
and born in Dublin of English parents,
November 30th, 1667. When a year old he was kidnapped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
by his nurse out of pure affection, and carried off to
Whitehaven, where she remained with the child for three
years. At the age of six the boy was sent to Kilkenny
school, and there he had William Congreve (1670-1729),
the future dramatist, for a schoolfellow. Neither at school
nor at Trinity College, Dublin, which he entered as a boy
of fifteen, did Swift distinguish himself, and he left the
University in disgrace. At the Revolution he found a
refuge with his mother at Leicester, and she, through a
family relationship, obtained a position for her boy in the
house of Sir William Temple (1628-1698), who was accounted
a great man in his own day, and was famous alike
for statecraft and literature. By many readers he will be
best remembered as the husband of the charming Dorothy
Osborne, whose innocently sweet love-letters have not lost
their freshness in the lapse of two centuries.</p>

<p>There was a degree of servitude in Swift's position of
secretary, which galled his proud spirit. But Temple, so
far from treating him unkindly, introduced him to the
King, and employed him in 'affairs of great importance.'
In 1694 he left Temple, went to Dublin, took holy
orders, and lived as prebend of Kilroot on £100 a year.
In 1696 he resigned the office and returned to Moor
Park, where he remained until Sir William Temple's
death, in 1699. There he studied hard, ran up a steep hill
daily for exercise, and cultivated the acquaintance of
Esther Johnson, the 'Stella' destined to take a strange
part in Swift's history, then a mere girl, and a companion
of Temple's sister, who lived with him after his wife's death.</p>

<p>Swift began his literary career by writing Pindaric
odes, one of which led Dryden to say, and the prediction
was amply verified, 'Cousin Swift, you will never be a
poet.' Probably no man of genius ever wrote worse
poetry than is to be found in these portentous efforts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>Here is one fair illustration of his flights as an ode
writer, and the reader will not ask for more:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Were I to form a regular thought of Fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which is perhaps, as hard to imagine right<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As to paint Echo to the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would not draw the idea from an empty name;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Because, alas! when we all die,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Careless and ignorant posterity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although they praise the learning and the wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And though the title seems to show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The name and man by whom the book was writ,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet how shall they be brought to know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether that very name was he, or you, or I?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Less should I daub it o'er with transitory praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And water-colours of these days:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These days! where e'en th' extravagance of poetry<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is at a loss for figures to express<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men's folly, whimsies, and inconstancy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And by a faint description makes them less.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then tell us what is Fame, where shall we search for it?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look where exalted Virtue and Religion sit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enthroned with heavenly Wit!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Look where you see<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The greatest scorn of learned Vanity!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(And then how much a nothing is mankind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose reason is weighed down by popular air.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who, by that, vainly talks of baffling death,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And hopes to lengthen life by a transfusion of breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which yet whoe'er examines right will find<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To be an art as vain as bottling up of wind!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when you find out these, believe true Fame is there,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Far above all reward, yet to which all is due;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And this, ye great unknown! is only known in you.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is remarkable that at the very time Swift was perpetrating
these lyrical atrocities, he was at work on the <i>Tale
of a Tub</i>, which is generally regarded as the most masterly
effort of his genius. A critic has said that Swift's poetry
'lacks one quality only&mdash;imagination,' but verse without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
imagination is like a body without a soul, like a house without
windows, like a landscape-painting without atmosphere, and
no license of language will allow us to call Swift a poet.
Enough that he became a master of rhyme, and used it
with extraordinary facility. Dr. Johnson's estimate of
Swift's powers in this respect is a just one:</p>

<p>'In the poetical works of Dr. Swift there is not much
upon which the critic can exercise his powers. They are
often humorous, almost always light, and have the qualities
which recommend such compositions, ease and gaiety.
They are, for the most part, what their author intended.
The diction is correct, the numbers are smooth, and the
rhymes exact. There seldom occurs a hard-laboured expression,
or a redundant epithet; all his verses exemplify
his own definition of a good style; they consist of proper
words in proper places.'</p>

<p>The merits with which Swift's verse is credited are,
therefore, not poetical merits, unless we accept what
Schlegel calls the miserable doctrine of Boileau, that the
essence of poetry consists in diction and versification.</p>

<p>The great bulk of Swift's verse is suggested by the
incidents of the hour. No subject is too trivial for his
pen; but the poems which are addressed to Stella, and
others which, like <i>Cadenus and Vanessa</i>, and <i>On the
Death of Dr. Swift</i>, have a personal interest, are by far the
most attractive. We see the best side of Swift when he
addresses Stella, whether in verse or prose. The birthday
rhymes he delighted to write in her praise have the mark
of sincerity, and there is true feeling in the lines which
describe her as a ministering angel in his sickness:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'When on my sickly couch I lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impatient both of night and day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lamenting in unmanly strains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called every power to ease my pains;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Stella ran to my relief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cheerful face and inward grief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though by Heaven's severe decree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She suffers hourly more than me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No cruel master could require<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From slaves employed for daily hire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What Stella, by her friendship warmed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With vigour and delight performed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sinking spirits now supplies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cordials in her hands and eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now with a soft and silent tread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unheard she moves about my bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see her taste each nauseous draught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so obligingly am caught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bless the hand from whence they came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor dare distort my face for shame.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The poem in which Swift imagines what will take place
upon his death, is full of satiric humour, combined with
that vein of bitterness that is never long absent from his
writings. His humour is always allied to sadness; his
mirth often sounds like a cry of misery. In this poem he
pictures his gradual decay, and how his special friends,
anticipating the end, will show their tenderness by adding
largely to his years:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'He's older than he would be reckoned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well remembers Charles the Second.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hardly drinks a pint of wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that I doubt is no good sign.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His stomach too begins to fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last year we thought him strong and hale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now he's quite another thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wish he may hold out till Spring.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No enemy can match a friend, Swift adds, in portending a
great misfortune:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'He'd rather choose that I should die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than his prediction prove a lie,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">No one foretells I shall recover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all agree to give me over.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So he dies, and the first question asked is, 'What has
he left and who's his heir?' and when these questions are
answered, the Dean is blamed for his bequests. The news
spreads to London and is told at Court:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Kind Lady Suffolk, in the spleen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Runs laughing up to tell the Queen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Queen so gracious, mild, and good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cries, "Is he gone? 'tis time he should."'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the loss of the Dean will cause a brief regret to his
most intimate friends:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Poor Pope will grieve a month; and Gay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A week; and Arbuthnot a day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">St. John himself will scarce forbear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bite his pen and drop a tear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest will give a shrug, and cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I'm sorry&mdash;but we all must die."'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Why grieve, indeed, at the death of friends, since no loss is
more easy to supply, and in a year the Dean will be forgotten,
and his wit be out of date.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Some country squire to Lintot goes,<br /></span>

<p>Enough has been transcribed to show Swift's art in this
poem, which is of considerable, but not of wearisome
length. Perhaps ten or twelve pieces, in addition to those
already mentioned, will repay the student's attention.
One of the worthiest is a <i>Rhapsody on Poetry</i>. <i>Baucis and
Philemon</i>, too, is a lively piece that pleased Goldsmith,
and will please every reader. It was much altered from
the original draught at Addison's suggestion; but the
alterations are not improvements.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> <i>The City Shower</i> is a
piece of Dutch painting, reminding us of Crabbe. <i>Mrs.
Harris's Petition</i> is an admirable bit of fooling; <i>Mary the
Cook-Maid's Letter</i>, is in its way inimitable; and so, too, is
the amusing talk of 'my lady's waiting-woman' in <i>The
Grand Question Debated</i>.</p>

<p>It is difficult, unhappily, to pursue one's way through
Swift's poems, without being repelled again and again by
the filth in which it pleases him to wade. <i>The Beast's
Confession</i>, which has been reprinted in the <i>Selections from
Swift</i> (Clarendon Press), is not obscene, like <i>The Lady's
Dressing-Room</i>, <i>Strephon and Chloe</i>, and other poems of the
class; but it has the inhumanity which deforms the description
of the Houyhnhnms. Strange to say, in private
life Swift appears to have been not only moral in conduct,
but refined in conversation, and he is even said to have
rebuked Stella on one occasion for a slightly coarse
remark. His imagination was diseased, and he was himself
always apprehensive of the calamity under which he
became at last 'a driveller and a show.' 'I shall be like
that tree,' he said once to the poet Young, 'I shall die at
the top.'</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>
<p>It has been already said that <i>The Tale of a Tub</i> was
written at Moor Park. It appeared in 1704, and although
published anonymously and never owned, the book
effectually stood in the way of Swift's high preferment in
the Church. Queen Anne declined, and not without
reason, to make its author a bishop.</p>

<p>It is a satire of amazing power, written by a man who
takes, as Swift took throughout life, a misanthropical view
of human nature, and who agrees with the cynical judgment
of Carlyle, that men are mostly fools. Swift, however,
did not consider fools useless, but observes that they
'are as necessary for a good writer as pen, ink, and paper.'
Never was volume written which betrayed in larger
characters the opinions and disposition of its author.
Swift was consistent in defending the National Church as
a political institution; but in the <i>Tale of a Tub</i> he does
so with weapons an atheist might use if he possessed the
skill. The author maintains that in his ridicule of the
Church of Rome and of Protestant dissenters, he is only
displaying the abuses which deform the Christian Church;
but no defence can be urged for his wild and irreverent
method of turning subjects into ridicule which by a vast
number of people are regarded as sacred. In judging of
Swift's satire from a moral standing-point, one test, as Mr.
Leslie Stephen observes, may be supposed to guide our decision.
'Imagine the <i>Tale of a Tub</i> to be read by Bishop
Butler and by Voltaire, who called Swift a <i>Rabelais perfectionné</i>.
Can anyone doubt that the believer would be
scandalized, and the scoffer find himself in a thoroughly
congenial element? Would not any believer shrink from
the use of such weapons, even though directed against his
enemies?'<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>
<p>Although the wit poured out with such profusion in the
<i>Tale of a Tub</i>, in so far as it offends the moral sense, fails
to give pleasure, the reader is astonished, as Swift in later
life was himself, at the genius displayed in this allegory,
the argument of which may be told in a few words.</p>

<p>A man is supposed to have three sons by one wife, and
all at a birth. On his deathbed he leaves to each of them
a new coat, which he says will grow with their growth, and
last as long as they live. In his will he leaves directions,
saying how the coats are to be used, and warning them
against neglecting his instructions. For some years all
goes well, the will is studied and followed, and the
brothers, Peter (the Church of Rome), Martin (the Church
of England), and Jack (the Calvinist), live in unity. How
by degrees they misinterpret their father's will, how Peter
begins by adding topknots to his coat, and afterwards
grows so scandalous that his brothers resolve to leave him,
and then fall out between themselves, is told with abundant
wit. A great part of the volume consists of digressions
written in Swift's most vigorous style, and with the
cynical humour in which he has no competitor.</p>

<p>It is always interesting to observe the influence of a
work of genius on other minds, and in connection with the
<i>Tale of a Tub</i> a story told of his boyhood by William Cobbett
is worth recording:</p>

<p>'I was trudging through Richmond,' he writes, 'in my
blue smock-frock, and my red garters tied under my knees,
when, staring about me, my eyes fell upon a little book in
a bookseller's window, on the outside of which was written,
"<i>Tale of a Tub</i>, price threepence." The title was so odd
that my curiosity was excited.... It was something so
new to my mind that though I could not at all understand
some of it, it delighted me beyond description; and it produced
what I have always considered a sort of birth of in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>tellect.
I read on till it was dark, without any thought of
supper or bed.' Cobbett adds, that having read till he
could see no longer, he put the volume in his pocket, and
'tumbled down' by the side of a haystack, 'where I slept
till the birds in Kew Gardens awakened me in the morning;
when off I started to Kew, reading my little book.'</p>

<p>One of the greatest masters of prose in the language has
also recorded the impression made upon him by this wonderful
book. At the age of eighty-three Landor wrote: 'I
am reading once more the work I have read oftener than
any other prose work in our language.... What a writer!
Not the most imaginative or the most simple, not Bacon
or Goldsmith had the power of saying more forcibly or
completely whatever he meant to say.' 'Simplicity,' said
Swift, 'is the best and truest ornament of most things in
human life;' and Landor, commenting on Swift's style,
observes that 'he never attempted to round his sentences
by redundant words, aware that from the simplest and the
fewest arise the secret springs of genuine harmony.'</p>

<p>The volume containing the <i>Tale of a Tub</i> had also within
its covers the <i>Battle of the Books</i>, which was suggested by
a controversy that originated in France, and had been
carried on by Sir W. Temple in England, as to the relative
merits of the Ancients and the Moderns. Out of this, too,
arose a discussion by some <i>savants</i>, with Richard Bentley
(1662-1742), the greatest scholar of the age, at their head,
with regard to the genuineness of the <i>Epistles of Phalaris</i>,
a subject discussed in Macaulay's essay on Temple in his
usually brilliant style. Swift, in the <i>Battle of the Books</i>
sides with Temple and with Charles Boyle, the nominal
editor of the <i>Epistles</i>, who, in the famous <i>Reply to Bentley</i>,
fought behind the shield of Atterbury. In a combat,
which takes place in the Homeric style, the enemies of
the Ancients, Bentley and Wotton, are slain by one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
lance upon the field. The mighty deed was achieved
by Boyle. 'As when a slender cook has trussed a brace
of woodcocks, he with iron skewer pierces the tender
sides of both, their legs and wings close pinioned to their
ribs, so was this pair of friends transfixed, till down they
fell joined in their lives, joined in their deaths; so closely
joined, that Charon would mistake them both for one, and
waft them over Styx for half his fare.' The humour of the
piece is delightful, and it matters not a whit for the enjoyment
of it, that the wrong heroes gain the victory.</p>

<p>In 1708 Swift produced several pamphlets or tracts, and
in one of them, the <i>Argument against Abolishing Christianity</i>,
he found ample scope for the irony of which he was so
consummate a master.</p>

<p>'Great wits,' he writes, 'love to be free with the highest
objects; and if they cannot be allowed a God to revile or renounce,
they will speak evil of dignities, abuse the Government,
and reflect upon the ministry; which I am sure few
will deny to be of much more pernicious consequence;' and
he observes, in concluding the argument: 'Whatever some
may think of the great advantages to trade by this favourite
scheme, I do very much apprehend that in six months'
time the Bank and East India Stock may fall at least one
<i>per cent.</i> And since that is fifty times more than ever the
wisdom of our age thought fit to venture for the preservation
of Christianity, there is no reason we should be at so
great a loss merely for the sake of destroying it.'</p>

<p>An amusing piece which appeared also at this time from
Swift's pen, is of literary interest. Under the name of
Isaac Bickerstaff he predicted the death, upon a certain
day, of Partridge, a notorious astrologer and almanac
maker. When the day arrived his decease was announced,
and he was afterwards decently buried by Swift, despite
a loud protest from the poor man that he was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
only alive, but well and hearty. The town took up the
joke, all the wits joined in it, and Steele, who started
the <i>Tatler</i> in the following year (1709), found it of
advantage to assume the name of Bickerstaff, which these
squibs had made so popular. Swift loved practical
jokes, and sometimes yielded to a license that bordered
on buffoonery. He was now in London, charged with a
mission from the Irish Church, and hoping for Church
preferment himself. With the latter object in view
he published the <i>Sentiments of a Church of England
Man</i> (1708). Two years later, vexed at heart at being
unable to gain for the Irish clergy privileges enjoyed by
their English brethren, and foiled, too, in his ambition,
Swift forsook the Whig party, which he had never loved,
and going over to the Tories, fought their battle for some
years with so masterly a pen, as to become a great power
in the country.</p>

<p>Some time before his return to London in 1710, a
weekly Tory paper had been started by Bolingbroke and
Prior called <i>The Examiner</i>, and in opposition to it, upon
September 14th in that year, Addison produced the <i>Whig
Examiner</i> which lived a brief life of five numbers and died
on the 8th of October. Three weeks later, on the 2nd
November, after thirteen numbers of the <i>Examiner</i> had
been published, Swift took up the pen, and from that date
to June 14th, 1711, every paper was from his hand. Never
before had a political journal exercised such power. In
his change of party Swift was sincere in purpose, but unscrupulous
in his methods of pursuing it, and to gain his
ends told lies with a vigour that has rarely been surpassed.
He is never delicate in his treatment of opponents,
and when finer weapons would be useless, strikes
with a sledge hammer. That such a writer, a master of
every method most effective in controversy, should have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
been valued by the statesmen of the day is not surprising.
When he forsook the Whig camp there was no opponent to
pit against him, for neither Addison with his delicate
humour, nor Steele with his brightness and versatility,
could grapple with an enemy like this.</p>

<p>Swift's arrogance in these days of his power was that of
a despot. He was doing great things for ministers, and
took care that they should know it. He was proud of his
self-assertion, proud of being rude. Great men, and great
ladies too, who wished for his acquaintance, had to make
the first advances. He caused Lady Burlington to burst
into tears by rudely ordering her to sing. 'She should
sing or he would make her.' 'I was at court and church
to-day,' he tells Stella, 'I generally am acquainted with about
thirty in the drawing-room, and am so proud I make all the
lords come up to me.' On one occasion he sent the Lord
Treasurer into the House of Commons to call out the principal
Secretary of State in order to say that he would not dine
with him if he intended to dine late. He relates, too, how
he warned St. John not to appear cold to him, for he would
not be treated like a school-boy, and if he heard or saw anything
to his disadvantage to let him know in plain words,
and not to put him in pain by the change of his behaviour,
for it was what he would hardly bear from a crowned head.
'If we let these great ministers pretend too much,' he says,
'there will be no governing them.' And in a letter to
Pope he makes the following confession: 'All my endeavours
from a boy to distinguish myself were only for want
of a great title and fortune that I might be treated like a
lord ... whether right or wrong it is no great matter;
and so the reputation of great learning does the work of a
blue ribbon, and of a coach and six horses.'</p>

<p>It would be out of place in this volume to dwell on
Swift's feats as a political writer; for us the most interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>ing
fact connected with the years 1710-14 is that during
that eventful period of Swift's life, in which he was hobnobbing
with Ministers of State and doing them infinite
service by his pen, he was writing at odd moments
his inimitable <i>Journal to Stella</i>, and gaining the love which
ended so tragically, of Hester Vanhomrigh. This strange
chapter in Swift's life is closely bound up with his literary
history, and must therefore be briefly noticed.</p>

<p>At Moor Park Swift, who was more than twenty years
her senior, had seen Esther Johnson growing up into
womanhood. He had been to her as a master, a position
he always liked to assume towards women.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> When he
settled in Ireland it was arranged that Esther and her
companion, Mrs. Dingley, should also live there. Her
preceptor, in his regard for propriety, appears never to
have seen Esther apart from the useful Dingley, and his
letters are apparently addressed to both of them, but
Esther knew, as we know, that all the tenderness and affectionate
humour they contain was meant for her alone.
Swift never writes as a lover, but the kind of love he gave
to 'Stella' sufficed to bind her to him for life. If there
were moments when she wished to escape from his power,
the wish was hopeless. Having once submitted to his
fascination, she was held by it to the end. Hester Vanhomrigh,
who was about ten years younger than Stella, felt
the same spell, and having a far less restrained nature than
Miss Johnson, gave free expression to the passion which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
devoured her. Between his two admirers, for such they
were, Swift had a difficult course to steer. To Stella he
was linked by strong ties of companionship, and to her,
according to some authorities, he was secretly married.
Whether this were the case or not she had the larger claims
upon him, and if one of the twain had to be sacrificed,
Vanessa must be the victim.</p>

<p>In <i>Cadenus and Vanessa</i> (1713) a poem which every
student of Swift will read, the author strove to achieve an
impossibility. His aim was to ignore the lover and to
assume the character of a master to an intelligent and
favourite pupil, or of a father to a daughter. His dignity
and age, he says, forbade the thought of warmer feelings.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'But friendship in its greatest height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A constant rational delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Virtue's basis fixed to last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When love's allurements long are past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which gently warms but cannot burn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gladly offers in return;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His want of passion will redeem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gratitude, respect, esteem;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that devotion we bestow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When goddesses appear below.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And this was Swift's method of dealing with a woman
who confessed the 'inexpressible passion' she had for him,
and that his 'dear image' was always before her eyes.
'Sometimes,' she wrote, 'you strike me with that prodigious
awe, I tremble with fear; at other times a charming compassion
shines through your countenance which moves my soul.'
Swift had acted far more than indiscreetly in encouraging
a friendship with Vanessa, and when she followed him to
Dublin, in the neighbourhood of which she had some property,
he knew not how to escape from the snare his own
folly had laid. To Stella he had given 'friendship and
esteem,' but, as he is careful to add, 'ne'er admitted love a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
guest;' the same cold gift was offered to Vanessa, but in vain.
According to a report, the authority of which is doubtful,
Miss Vanhomrigh wrote to Stella, in 1723, asking if she
was Swift's wife. She replied that she was, and sent the
letter she had received to Swift. In a towering passion he
rode to Vanessa's house, threw the letter on the table, and
left again without saying a word. The blow was fatal, and
Vanessa died soon afterwards, revoking her will in Swift's
favour and leaving to him the legacy of remorse. Having
told in outline this episode in Swift's story, I return to the
<i>Journal to Stella</i>, which dates from September 2nd, 1710,
to June 6th, 1713.</p>

<p>Little did Swift imagine that the chit-chat he was
writing every day for Esther Johnson's sake would be read
and enjoyed by thousands who care little or nothing for
the party questions upon which the strenuous efforts
of his intellect were expended. The early years of the
eighteenth century contain nothing more delightful than
this <i>Journal</i>. Its gossip, its nonsense, its freshness and
ease of style, the tenderness concealed, or half-revealed, in
its 'little language,' and the illustrations it supplies incidentally
of the manners of the court and town, these are
some of the charms that make us turn again and again to
its pages with ever-increasing pleasure. We enjoy Swift's
egotism and trivialities, as we enjoy the egotism of Pepys
or Montaigne, and can imagine the eagerness with which the
<i>Letters</i> were read by the lovely woman whose destiny it
was to receive everything from Swift save the love which
has its consummation in marriage. The style of the <i>Journal</i>
is not that of an author composing, but of a companion
talking; and it is all the more interesting since it reveals
Swift's character under a pleasanter aspect than any of his
formal writings. We see in it what a warm heart he had
for the friends whom he had once learnt to love, and with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
what zeal he exerted himself in assisting brother-authors,
while receiving little beyond empty praise from ministers
himself.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1713-14 Swift joined the Scriblerus
Club, an association of such wits as Pope, Parnell, Arbuthnot,
and Gay, and it was about this time that his friendship
with Pope began. The members proposed writing a
satire between them, and when Swift was exiled to Dublin
as Dean of St. Patrick's, he pursued indirectly the suggestion
of the Scriblerus wits by writing <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>
(1726), a book that has made his name known throughout
Europe, and in all the lands where English literature is
read. Although Swift did not hesitate to make use of
hints and descriptions which he had met with in the
course of his reading, this is one of the most original works
of fiction ever written, and one of the wittiest. Yet like
almost everything that Swift wrote, it is deformed by grossness
of expression, and in the latter portion by a malignant
contempt for human nature which betrays a diseased imagination.
The stories of the Lilliputians and Brobdingnags,
purified from coarse allusions, are the delight of children;
but the description of the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos excites
disgust and indignation. He said that his object in
writing the satire was to vex the world, and he has
succeeded.</p>

<p>'It cannot be denied,' says Sir Walter Scott, one of the
sanest and healthiest of imaginative writers, 'that even a
moral purpose will not justify the nakedness with which
Swift has sketched this horrible outline of mankind degraded
to a bestial state; since a moralist ought to hold with the
Romans that crimes of atrocity should be exposed when
punished, but those of flagitious impurity concealed. In
point of probability, too&mdash;for there are degrees of probability,
proper even to the wildest fiction&mdash;the fourth part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
of <i>Gulliver</i> is inferior to the three others.... The mind
rejects, as utterly impossible, the supposition of a nation
of horses, placed in houses which they could not build, fed
with corn which they could neither sow, reap, nor save,
possessing cows which they could not milk, depositing that
milk in vessels which they could not make, and, in short,
performing a hundred purposes of rational and social life
for which their external structure altogether unfits them.'<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Neither morality, nor a regard for probability are so
outraged in the story of the Lilliputians and Brobdingnags.</p>

<p>Having once accepted Swift's assumption of the existence
of little people not six inches high, and of a country in which
the inhabitants 'appeared as tall as an ordinary spire-steeple,'
the exactness and verisimilitude of the narrative,
with its minute geographical details, make it appear so
reasonable that a young reader may feel inclined to resent
the criticism of an Irish bishop who said that 'the book
was full of improbable lies, and for his part he hardly
believed a word of it.' It is curious to note that Swift,
who made a strange vow in early life 'not to be fond of
children, or let them come near me hardly,' should have
done more to delight them than any author of his century,
with the exception, perhaps, of Defoe. Gay and Pope
wrote a joint letter to Swift on the appearance of the
<i>Travels</i>, pretending that they did not know the author,
and advising him to get the book if it had not yet reached
Ireland. 'From the highest to the lowest,' they declare, 'it
is universally read, from the cabinet council to the nursery....
It has passed Lords and Commons <i>nemine contradicente</i>,
and the whole town, men, women, and children,
are quite full of it.' A book which attained in the author's
lifetime a wellnigh unprecedented popularity should have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
yielded him a large profit. What it did yield we do not
know, but in a letter dated 1735, in which, perhaps, he
alludes to the <i>Travels</i>, Swift says, 'I never got a farthing
for anything I writ, except once, about eight years ago,
and that by Mr. Pope's prudent management for me.'</p>

<p>The injustice done to Ireland in the last century, as
short-sighted as it was cruel, is described at large in the
second volume of Mr. Lecky's <i>History</i>. Swift, who hated
Ireland, felt a righteous indignation at the misgovernment
which threatened the country with ruin, and some of his
most powerful phillipics were secretly written in her defence.</p>

<p>In 1720 he issued a pamphlet urging the Irish to use
only Irish manufactures: 'I heard the late Archbishop of
Tuam,' he writes, 'mention a pleasant observation of somebody's,
that Ireland would never be happy till a law were
made for burning everything that came from England,
except their people and their coals. I must confess, that
as to the former, I should not be sorry if they would stay
at home; and for the latter, I hope, in a little time we shall
have no occasion for them</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Non tanti mitra est, non tanti judicis ostrum&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but I should rejoice to see a staylace from England be
thought scandalous, and become a topic for censure at
visits and tea-tables.'</p>

<p>The pamphlet is a forcible attack on the oppression
under which Ireland laboured, and the Government
answered it by prosecuting the printer. Nine times the
jury were sent back by the Chief Justice before they consented
to bring in a 'special verdict,' and ultimately the
prosecution was dropped.</p>

<p>Two years later the English Government granted a
patent to a man of the name of Wood to issue a new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
copper coinage for Ireland to an extravagant amount, out
of which, in return for bribes to the Duchess of Kendal, it
was supposed that the speculator would make a considerable
profit at Ireland's expense. The country was
aroused, and Swift, by the issue of the <i>Drapier's Letters</i>,
purporting to come from a Dublin draper, roused the
passions of the people to a white heat. It was known
perfectly well from whom the <i>Letters</i> came, but no one
would betray Swift, and when the printer was thrown into
prison the jury refused to convict. The battle was fought
with vigour, Swift conquered, and the patent was withdrawn.
A brief passage from the fourth and final letter
'To the Whole People of Ireland' shall be quoted. It will
be seen that the writer is not afraid of plain speaking.
After saying that the king cannot compel the subject to
take any money except it be sterling gold or silver, he
adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Now here you may see that the vile accusation of
Wood and his accomplices, charging us with disputing the
King's prerogative by refusing his brass, can have no place&mdash;because
compelling the subject to take any coin which is
not sterling is no part of the King's prerogative, and I am
very confident, if it were so, we should be the last of his
people to dispute it, as well from that inviolable loyalty we
have always paid to his Majesty, as from the treatment we
might in such a case justly expect from some, who seem to
think we have neither common sense nor common senses.
But, God be thanked, the best of them are only our fellow-subjects,
and not our masters. One great merit I am sure
we have which those of English birth can have no pretence
to&mdash;that our ancestors reduced this kingdom to the
obedience of England; for which we have been rewarded
with a worse climate&mdash;the privilege of being governed by
laws to which we do not consent&mdash;a ruined trade&mdash;a House
of Peers without jurisdiction&mdash;almost an incapacity for all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
employments&mdash;and the dread of Wood's halfpence. But
we are so far from disputing the king's prerogative in
coining, that we own he has power to give a patent to any
man for setting his royal image and superscription upon
whatever materials he pleases, and liberty to the patentee
to offer them in any country from England to Japan; only
attended with one small limitation&mdash;that nobody alive is
obliged to take them.'</p></div>

<p>With much humour, in the last paragraph of the letter,
Swift undertakes to show that Walpole is against Wood's
project 'by this one invincible argument, that he has the
universal opinion of being a wise man, an able minister,
and in all his proceedings pursuing the true interest of the
King his master; and that as his integrity is above all
corruption, so is his fortune above all temptation.'</p>

<p>Swift's arguments in the <i>Drapier's Letters</i> are sophistical,
his statements grossly exaggerated, and his advice
sometimes shameless, as, for instance, in recommending
what is now but too well known as 'boycotting.'
The end, however, was gained, and the Dean
was treated with the honours of a conqueror. On his
return from England in 1726, a guard of honour conducted
him through the streets, and the city bells sounded
a joyful peal. Wherever he went he was received with
something like royal honours, and when Walpole talked
of arresting him, he was told that 10,000 soldiers would
be needed to make the attempt successful. The Dean's
hatred of oppression and injustice had its limits. He
defended the Test Act, and assailed all dissenters with
ungovernable fury. It was his aim to exclude them from
every kind of power.</p>

<p>In 1729, with a passion outwardly calm and in a moderate
style, which makes his amazing satire the more
appalling, Swift published <i>A Modest Proposal for Prevent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>ing
the Children of Poor People in Ireland from being a
Burden to their Parents or Country and for making them
Beneficial to the Public</i>. A more hideous piece of irony
was never written; it is the fruit of an indignation that
tore his heart. The <i>Proposal</i> is, that considering the great
misery of Ireland, young children should be used for food.
'I grant,' he says,'this food will be somewhat dear, and
therefore very proper for landlords, who, as they have
already devoured most of the parents, seem to have the
best title to the children. 'A very worthy person, he
says, considers that young lads and maidens over twelve
would supply the want of venison, but 'it is not improbable
that some scrupulous people might be apt to censure
such a practice (although, indeed, very unjustly), as a
little bordering upon cruelty; which I confess has always
been with me the strongest objection against any project,
how well soever intended.' The business-like way in which
the argument is conducted throughout, adds greatly to its
force. Swift has written nothing so terrible as this satire,
and nothing that surpasses it in power.</p>

<p>The Dean was fretting away his life when he wrote this
pamphlet. Two years before he had paid his last visit to
the country where, as he said in a letter to Gay, he had
made his friendships and left his desires. On the death
of George I. he visited England, vainly hoping to
gain some preferment there through the aid of Mrs.
Howard, the mistress of George II., and returned to
'wretched Dublin,' to lose the woman he had loved so well
and treated so strangely, and to 'die in a rage like a
poisoned rat in a hole.' After Stella's death, in 1728,
Swift's burden of misanthropy was never destined to be
lightened. His rage and gloom increased as the years
moved on, and in penning his lines of savage invective
against the Irish House of Commons, the Dean had a fit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
and wrote no more verse. Here is a specimen of his <i>sæva
indignatio</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Could I from the building's top<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear the rattling thunder drop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the devil upon the roof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(If the devil be thunder-proof)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should with poker fiery red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crack the stones and melt the lead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drive them down on every skull,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the den of thieves is full;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quite destroy that harpies' nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How might then our isle be blest!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It should be observed at the same time that even in his
declining days, when his heart was heavy with bitterness,
Swift indulged in practical jokes and in the most trivial
pursuits. <i>Vive la bagatelle</i> was his cry, but it was the cry
of a man who had as deep a contempt for the wiser pursuits
of life as for its frivolities. Of the mirth that is the
natural outcome of a cheerful nature, the Dean knew
nothing. His hilarity was but a vain attempt to escape
from despair. In 1740 he writes of being very miserable,
extremely deaf, and full of pain. Sometimes he gave way
to furious bursts of temper, and for several years before
the end came, he fell into a state resembling idiocy. Swift
died on October 19th, 1745, leaving his money to a hospital
for lunatics,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'And showed by one satiric touch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No nation needed it so much.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A brilliant writer, who has undertaken to prove the
'glaring injustice' of the popular estimate of Swift, and by
his forcible epithets has strengthened the grounds on which
that estimate is built, observes that Swift's 'philosophy of
life is ignoble, base, and false,' that 'his impious mockery
extends even to the Deity,' and that 'a large portion of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
works exhibit, and in intense activity, all the worst attributes
of our nature&mdash;revenge, spite, malignity, uncleanness.'<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>This harsh judgment is essentially a true one; but Swift's
was a many-sided character. He was a misanthrope, with
deep, though very limited affections, a man frugal to
eccentricity, with a benevolence at once active and extensive.
His powerful intellect compels our admiration, if
not our sympathy. His irony, his genius for satire and
humour, his argumentative skill, his language, which is
never wanting in strength, and is as clear as the most
pellucid of mountain streams&mdash;these gifts are of so rare
an order, that Swift's place in the literary history of his
age must be always one of high eminence. Doubtless, as
a master of style, he has been sometimes over-praised. If
we regard the writer's end, it must be admitted that his
language is admirably fitted for that end. What more
then, it may be asked, can be needed? The reply is, that
in composition, as in other things, there are different
orders of excellence. The kind, although perfect, may be
a low kind, and Swift's style wants the 'sweetness and
light,' to quote a phrase of his own, which distinguish our
greatest prose writers. It lacks also the elevation which
inspires, and the persuasiveness that convinces while it
charms. With infinitely more vigour than Addison, Swift,
apart from his <i>Letters</i>, has none of Addison's attractiveness.
No style, perhaps, is better fitted to exhibit scorn
and contempt; but its author cannot express, because he
does not possess, the sense of beauty.</p>

<p>Unlike Pope, Swift was a man of affairs rather than of
letters. He wrote neither for literary fame nor for
money. His ambition was to be a ruler of men, and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
imperious will he was strong enough to make a second
Strafford. 'When people ask me,' said Lord Carteret,
'how I governed Ireland, I say that I pleased Dr. Swift,
"<i>quæsitam meritis sume superbiam</i>."' As a political
pamphleteer he succeeded, because he was savagely in
earnest, and had the special genius of a combatant.
If argument was against him he used satire; if satire
failed he tried invective; his armoury was full of
weapons, and there was not one of them he could not
wield. He loved power, and exercised it on the ministers
who needed the services of his pen. And, as we have
already said, he dispensed his favours like a king! Swift's
commanding genius gives even to his most trivial productions
a measure of vitality. The student of our eighteenth
century literature is arrested by the man and his works,
and to treat either him or them with indifference would
be to neglect a significant chapter in the history of the
time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John Arbuthnot
(1667-1735).</div>

<p>John Arbuthnot, one of the most prominent of the
Queen Anne wits, and the warm friend of
Swift and Pope, was born at Arbuthnot,
near Montrose, in 1667. He studied medicine
at Aberdeen, and having taken his doctor's degree at
St. Andrews, came, after the wont of ambitious Scotchmen,
to seek his fortune in London, where in 1700 he published
an <i>Essay on the Usefulness of Mathematical Learning</i>,
and having won high reputation as a man of science, was
elected a fellow of the Royal Society. A few years later
he was made Physician Extraordinary to Queen Anne;
and it was not long before he had as high a repute among
men of letters as with men of science. He suffered frequently
from illness; but no pain, it has been said, could
extinguish his gaiety of mind. In the last century Hampstead
was a favourite resort of invalids. Arbuthnot had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
sent Gay there on one occasion, and thither in 1734 he
went himself, so ill that he 'could neither sleep, breathe,
eat, nor move.' Contrary to his expectation he regained a
little strength, and lived until the following spring.
'Pope and I were with him,' Lord Chesterfield wrote, 'the
evening before he died, when he suffered racking pains....
He took leave of us with tenderness, without weakness,
and told us that he died not only with the comfort,
but even the devout assurance of a Christian.'</p>

<p>There is not one of Pope's circle who holds a more
enviable position than Arbuthnot. In strength of intellect
and readiness of wit Swift only was his equal, and in
classical learning he was Swift's superior. Like Othello,
Arbuthnot was of a free and open nature, and his friends
clung to him with an affection that was almost womanly.
He had the fine impulses of Goldsmith combined with the
manliness and practical sagacity of Dr. Johnson, and
Johnson recognized in this celebrated physician a kindred
spirit. 'I think Dr. Arbuthnot,' he said, 'the first man
among the wits of the age. He was the most universal
genius, being an excellent physician, a man of deep learning,
and a man of much humour.' His genius and generous
qualities were amply acknowledged by his contemporaries,
Pope calls Arbuthnot 'as good a doctor as any man for one
that is ill, and a better doctor for one that is well;' Swift
said he had every virtue which could make a man amiable;
Berkeley wrote of him as a great philosopher who was
reckoned the first mathematician of the age and had the
character 'of uncommon virtue and probity,' and Chesterfield,
who declared that his knowledge and 'almost inexhaustible
imagination' were at every one's service, added
that 'charity, benevolence, and a love of mankind appeared
unaffectedly in all he said and did.'</p>

<p>Strange to say we know little of Arbuthnot but what is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
to be gleaned from the correspondence of his friends, and
it is only of late years that an attempt has been made
to write the doctor's biography, and to collect his works.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
To edit these works satisfactorily is a difficult and a
doubtful task&mdash;several of Arbuthnot's writings having
been produced in connection with Swift, Pope, and Gay.
So indifferent was he to literary fame, that his children are
said to have made kites of papers in which he had jotted
down hints that would have furnished good matter for folios.
His most famous work is <i>The History of John Bull</i> (1713),
which Macaulay considered the most humorous political
satire in the language. It was designed to help the Tory
party at the expense of the Duke of Marlborough, whose
genius as a military leader was probably equal to that of
Wellington, while he fell far below the 'Great Duke'
in the virtues which form a noble character. The irony
and dry humour of the satire remind one of Swift, and,
like Arbuthnot's <i>Art of Political Lying</i>, is so much in
Swift's vein throughout that M. Taine may be excused
for attributing both of these pieces to the Dean of St.
Patrick's.</p>

<p>The <i>History of John Bull</i> is not fitted to attain lasting
popularity. It will be read from curiosity and for information;
but the keen excitement, the amusement, and the
irritation caused by a brilliant satire of living men and
passing events can be but vaguely imagined by readers
whose interest in the statecraft of the age is historical
and not personal. Arbuthnot, like Swift, belonged to
the Tory camp, and both did their utmost to depreciate
the great General who never knew defeat, and to promote
the designs of Harley. When Arbuthnot produced
his satire, all the town laughed at the representation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
of Marlborough as an old smooth-tongued attorney who
loved money, and was said by his neighbours to be hen-pecked,
'which was impossible by such a mild-spirited
woman as his wife was.' That an 'honest plain-dealing
fellow' like John Bull the Clothier, should be deceived by
such wily men of business as Lewis Baboon of France, and
Lord Strutt of Spain, and also that other tradesmen should
be willing to join John and Nic Frog, the linen-draper of
Holland, in the lawsuit, provided that Bull and Frog, or
Bull alone, would bear the law charges, is made to appear
likely enough; and Scott says truly that 'it was
scarce possible so effectually to dim the lustre of Marlborough's
splendid achievements as by parodying them
under the history of a suit conducted by a wily attorney
who made every advantage gained over the defendant a
reason for protracting law procedure, and enhancing the
expense of his client.' In this long lawsuit everybody is
represented as gaining something except <i>John Bull</i>, whose
ready money, book debts, bonds, and mortgages go into
the lawyer's pockets. Whether the nickname of <i>John Bull</i>
originated with Arbuthnot or was merely adopted by him
is not known.</p>

<p>Arbuthnot was an active member of the Scriblerus Club,
and wrote the larger portion of the <i>Memoirs of Martin Scriblerus</i>
(1741), the design of which was, as Pope said, to ridicule
false tastes in learning, in the character of a man 'that
had dipped into every art and science, but injudiciously in
each.' Dr. Johnson says of this work that no man can be
wiser, better, or merrier for remembering it. Perhaps he
is right; but the <i>Memoirs</i> contain some humorous points
which, if they do not create merriment, may yield some
slight amusement. The pedant's endeavours to make a
philosopher of his child are sufficiently ludicrous. He
is delighted to find that the infant has the wart of Cicero<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
and the very neck of Alexander, and hopes that he may
come to stammer like Demosthenes, 'and in time arrive
at many other defects of famous men.' As the boy grows
up his father invents for him a geographical suit of clothes,
and stamps his gingerbread with the letters of the Greek
alphabet, which proved so successful a mode of teaching the
language, that on the very first day the child 'ate as far as
iota.' He also taught him as a diversion 'an odd and
secret manner of stealing, according to the custom of the
Lacedemonians, wherein he succeeded so well that he practised
it till the day of his death.' Martin studies logic,
philosophy, and medicine, and discovers that the seat of the
soul is not confined to one place in all persons, but resides
in the stomach of epicures, in the brain of philosophers, in
the fingers of fiddlers, and in the toes of rope-dancers. His
discoveries, it may be added, are made 'without the trivial
help of experiments or observations.'</p>

<h3>DANIEL DEFOE&mdash;JOHN DENNIS&mdash;COLLEY CIBBER&mdash;LADY
MARY WORTLEY MONTAGU&mdash;EARL OF CHESTERFIELD&mdash;LORD
LYTTELTON&mdash;JOSEPH SPENCE.</h3>


<div class="sidenote">Daniel Defoe
(1661-1731).</div>

<p>The most voluminous writer of his century is popularly
remembered as the author of one book, published
in old age. Everybody has read
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, and knows the name of its
author; but few readers outside the narrow circle of literary
students are aware of Defoe's exhaustless labours as a
politician, social reformer, projector, pamphleteer, and
novelist.</p>

<p>It would be well for the author's reputation if we knew
less about him than we do. There was a time when he
was regarded as a noble sufferer in the cause of civil and
religious liberty. His faults were credited to his age while
his virtues were supposed to place him on an eminence far
above the time-servers who despised him. He has been
praised as a man courageously living for great aims, who
was maligned by the malice of party, and to whose memory
scant justice has been done. 'No one,' says Henry Kingsley,
'could come up to the standard of his absolute precision,'
and his 'inexorable honesty alienated everyone.' These
words were written in 1868. Four years previously, however,
the discovery of six letters in the State Paper Office,
in Defoe's own hand, had entirely destroyed his character<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
for inexorable honesty, and the researches of his latest and
most exhaustive biographer,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> who regards his hero's vices as
virtues, do but serve to give greater prominence to the
baseness of his conduct. Defoe, by his own confession,
was for many years in the pay of the Government for secret
services, taking shares in Tory papers and supervising
them as editor, in order to defeat the aims of the party to
which he professed to be allied, and of the proprietors with
whom he was in partnership. Thus in 1718, he writes as
a plea that his labours should be remembered: 'I am, Sir,
for this service, posted among Papists, Jacobites, and enraged
High Tories&mdash;a generation who I profess my very
soul abhors; I am obliged to hear traitorous expressions
and outrageous words against his majesty's person and
government, and his most faithful servants, and smile at
it all as if I approved it; I am obliged to take all the
scandalous and indeed villainous papers that come, and
keep them by me as if I would gather materials from them
to put them into the <i>News</i>; nay, I often venture to let
things pass which are a little shocking that I may not
render myself suspected. Thus I bow in the House of
<i>Rimmon</i>, and must humbly recommend myself to his lordship's
protection, or I may be undone the sooner, by how
much the more faithfully I execute the commands I am
under.' It would not be fair to judge Defoe altogether
by the moral standard of our own day, but the part he
played as a servant and spy of the government would have
been an act of baseness in any age, and of this he seems to
have been conscious.</p>

<p>Daniel Foe, who about 1703 assumed the prefix of De,
for no assignable reason, was the son of a butcher and
Nonconformist in Cripplegate, who had the youth educated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
for the ministry. Daniel, however, preferred a more
exciting occupation, and took part in the unfortunate expedition
of the Duke of Monmouth. Escaping from that
peril he began business as a hose factor in Cornhill, and
carried it on until he failed about the year 1692. Already
he had learnt to use the pen, and a loyal pamphlet
secured for him a public appointment which lasted for
some years. He was also connected with a brick manufactory
at Tilbury. Meanwhile he wrote for the press, and
showed himself the possessor of a clear and masculine style,
which could be 'understanded of the people.'</p>

<p>In 1698 Defoe published his <i>Essay on Projects</i>, 'which
perhaps,' Benjamin Franklin says, 'gave me a turn of
thinking that had an influence on some of the principal
future events of my life.'</p>

<p>One of the most interesting projects in the book is the
proposal to form an Academy on the French model. In
1712 Swift wrote a pamphlet (the only piece he published
with his name) entitled <i>A proposal for correcting, improving,
and ascertaining the English tongue</i>, in which he suggests
the foundation of an Academy under the protection of the
Queen and her ministers. The idea it will be seen had
been anticipated fifteen years before.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'The peculiar study of the Academy of France,' Defoe
writes, 'has been to refine and correct their own language,
which they have done to that happy degree that we see it
now spoken in all the courts of Christendom as the language
allowed to be most universal. I had the honour once
to be a member of a small society who seemed to offer at
this noble design in England; but the greatness of the work
and the modesty of the gentlemen concerned prevailed with
them to desist from an enterprise which appeared too great
for private hands to undertake. We want indeed a Richelieu
to commence such a work, for I am persuaded were there
such a genius in our kingdom to lead the way, there would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
not want capacities who could carry on the work to a glory
equal to all that has gone before them. The English
tongue is a subject not at all less worthy the labours of
such a society than the French, and capable of a much
greater perfection. The learned among the French will
own that the comprehensiveness of expression is a glory in
which the English tongue not only equals, but excels its
neighbours.... It is a great pity that a subject so noble
should not have some as noble to attempt it; and for a
method what greater can be set before us than the Academy
of Paris, which, to give the French their due, stands foremost
among all the great attempts in the learned part of
the world.'</p></div>

<p>Defoe also projected a Royal Military Academy, and an
academy for women which should have only one entrance
and a large moat round it. With these precautions, spies, he
observes, would be unnecessary, since, in his opinion,
'there needs no other care to prevent intriguing than to
keep the men effectually away.' He had the Eastern
notion of guarding women from danger by preventing the
access to it, yet he could write:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'A woman of sense and manners is the finest and most
delicate part of God's creation; the glory of her Maker,
and the great instance of His singular regard to man, His
darling creature, to whom He gave the best gift either God
could bestow or man receive. And it is the sordidest piece
of folly and ingratitude in the world to withhold from the
sex the due lustre which the advantages of education gives
to the natural beauty of their minds. A woman well bred
and well taught, furnished with the additional accomplishments
of knowledge and behaviour, is a creature without
comparison; her society is the emblem of sublime enjoyments;
her person is angelic and her conversation heavenly....
She is every way suitable to the sublimest wish, and
the man that has such a one to his portion has nothing to
do but to rejoice in her and be thankful.'</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>In verse Defoe published the <i>True Born Englishman</i>
(1701), in defence of King William and his Dutch
followers:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'William's the name that's spoke by every tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">William's the darling subject of my song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listen, ye virgins, to the charming sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in eternal dances hand it round.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your early offerings to this altar bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make him at once a lover and a king.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The nonsense deepens as the rhyme goes on. For
William every tender vow is to be made, he is to be the
first thought in the morning, and his name will act as a
charm, affrighting the infernal powers and guarding from
the terror of the night.</p>

<p>The poem proved very popular, and Defoe writes that
had he been able to enjoy the profit of his own labour he
would have gained above £1,000. He printed nine editions
at the price of one shilling a copy, but meanwhile twelve
surreptitious editions were published and sold for a few
pence, a fraud for which he says he had no remedy but
patience. Throughout his busy life of authorship he was
indeed continually victimized by pirates.</p>

<p>While in verse Defoe extolled the king as if he
were a demi-god, he did William good service by his
pamphlets, and was in some degree admitted into his
confidence.</p>

<p>Up to the king's death in 1702 his course appears to
have been straightforward; after the accession of Anne he
acted a less honourable part. No fault can be found with
his design that year in writing <i>The Shortest Way with the
Dissenters</i>, a piece of irony unsurpassed in that age until
the publication of Swift's <i>Modest Proposal</i>, twenty-seven
years later. The satire was at first accepted as a serious
argument. The Dissenters were alarmed, and the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
bigoted of High Churchmen delighted. Then, Defoe's
aim being discovered, both parties joined in the cry for
vengeance. He was condemned to stand for three days in
the pillory, and was afterwards imprisoned in Newgate.
To the 'hieroglyphic state machine, contrived to punish
Fancy in,' the undaunted man addressed a hymn which was
hawked about the streets, and the mob instead of pelting
him with offensive missiles, covered him with flowers.
'Earless on high stood unabashed Defoe,' says Pope. He
was unabashed, but he was not earless.</p>

<p>In Newgate he remained until 1704, when he was released
by Harley. In prison he wrote a minutely circumstantial
account of the great storm commemorated in Addison's
<i>Campaign</i>. How much of Defoe's narrative is truth and
how much invention it is impossible to say. The fact that
he solemnly vouches for the accuracy of his statements inclines
one to believe that they are not to be trusted, for this
was always Defoe's <i>rôle</i> as a writer of fiction. His first
and most deliberate effort is to impose upon his readers,
and in this art he is without a rival.</p>

<p>While in Newgate he began his <i>Review</i>, a political journal
of great ability. The first number was published in
February, 1704, and it existed, though not in its original
form, for more than nine years.</p>

<p>'When it is remembered that no other pen was ever
employed than that of Defoe, upon a work appearing at
such frequent intervals, extending over more than nine
years, and embracing, in more than five thousand printed
pages, essays on almost every branch of human knowledge,
the achievement must be pronounced a great one, even if
he had written nothing else. If we add that between the
dates of the first and last numbers of the <i>Review</i> he wrote
and published no less than eighty other distinct works,
containing 4,727 pages, and perhaps more not now known,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the fertility of his genius must appear as astonishing as
the greatness of his capacity for labour.'<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Defoe was permitted to leave his prison upon condition
that he should act in the secret service of the Government,
and his work was that of an hireling writer unburdened
by principle. When Harley was ejected he made himself
useful to Godolphin; when Godolphin was dismissed he
went back to Harley, and 'the spirit of the <i>Review</i> changed
abruptly.' A more useful man for the work he had
undertaken could not be found. His dexterity, his boldness,
his knowledge of men and of affairs, his readiness as
a writer, and it must be added his unscrupulousness,
fitted him admirably for services which had to be done in
secret.</p>

<p>Much that he did openly was deserving of high praise.
He was tolerant in an intolerant age, he did his best to forward
the Union of England and Scotland, his patriotic
spirit was not feigned, his words are often weighty with
wisdom, and it has been truly said, that 'his powerful
advocacy was enlisted in favour of almost every practicable
scheme of social improvement that came to the front in his
time.'<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>With equal truth the writer adds that Defoe was 'a
wonderful mixture of knave and patriot.' The knavery is
seen to some extent in his method of workmanship as a
man of letters. In <i>A True Relation of the Apparition of
one Mrs. Veal<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> the next day after her Death to one Mrs. Bar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>grave
at Canterbury, 8th September, 1705</i> (1706) Defoe's
art of mystification is skilfully practised.</p>

<p>'This relation,' he says in the Preface, 'is matter of fact,
and attended with such circumstances as may induce any
reasonable man to believe it. It was sent by a gentleman,
a Justice of Peace at Maidstone, in Kent, and a very intelligent
person, to his friend in London as it is here worded;
which discourse is here attested by a very sober and understanding
gentleman, who had it from his kinswoman who
lives in Canterbury, within a few doors of the house in
which the within-named Mrs. Bargrave lives ... and
who positively assured him that the whole matter as it is
related and laid down is really true, and what she herself
had in the same words, as near as may be, from Mrs.
Bargrave's own mouth.'</p>

<p>In addition to this circumstantial statement, the veritable
appearance of the ghostly lady is confirmed by the fact
that she wore a scoured silk gown, newly made up, which,
as Mrs. Bargrave told a friend, she felt and commended.
'Then Mrs. Watson cried out, "you have seen her indeed,
for none knew but Mrs. Veal and myself that the gown
was scoured."' The ghost came chiefly for the purpose of
recommending Drelincourt's volume, <i>A Christian's Defence
Against the Fear of Death</i>, then in its third edition. The
fourth edition contained Mrs. Bargrave's story. 'I am
unable to say,' Mr. Lee writes, 'when Defoe's "Apparition"
became a necessary appendage to the book; but think,
that since the eleventh edition, to the present time, Drelincourt
has never been published without it.'</p>

<p>When in 1719, at the age of fifty-nine, he produced his
first and greatest work of fiction, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, he
aimed by the constant reiteration of commonplace details
to give a matter-of-fact aspect to the narrative, and in most
of his later novels, with the exception of <i>Colonel Jack</i> (1722),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
which he allows to be in part a 'moral romance,' Defoe
boldly maintains that his relations are in every respect
true to biography and to history. To make this more
probable he overloads his pages with a number of business-like
statements, and with affairs so insignificant and sordid
that only his genius can save the narrative from being
wearisome. To inculcate morality he carries his readers
into the worst dens of vice&mdash;his heroes being pickpockets,
pirates, and convicts, and his heroines depraved women of
the lowest order. The interest felt in <i>Captain Singleton</i>
(1720), in <i>Moll Flanders</i> (1722), in <i>Colonel Jack</i> (1722),
and in <i>Roxana</i> (1724), is to be found in the minute record
of their shameless adventures, their miseries and vices.
When the characters reform, Defoe's occupation is gone.
The atmosphere the reader is forced to breathe in these
tales is indeed so oppressive that he will be glad to
escape from it into the pure and exhilarating air of a
Shakespeare or a Scott.</p>

<p>A critic has asserted that as models of fictitious narrative
these tales are supreme, but it is impossible to agree with
this judgment. The highest imaginative art is not deceptive
art. The fact that Lord Chatham thought the
<i>Memoirs of a Cavalier</i><a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> (1720) a true history, is not to
the credit of the work as fiction. As well, it has been said,
might you claim the highest genius for the painter, whose
fruit and flowers were so deceptively painted as to tempt
birds to peck at the canvas.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>
<p>Whatever interest the reader feels in Defoe's 'secondary
novels,' of which <i>Roxana</i> is the most powerful, is due to
scenes which disgust as much as they impress. The vividness
with which they are depicted is undeniable, but one
does not desire to inspect filth with a microscope. Happily
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, on which the author's fame rests, is a
thoroughly healthy book that still holds its place as the
best, or one of the best, volumes ever written for boys.
There is genius as well as extraordinary skill in the way
this admirable story is told, but it is not among the fictions
which are read with as much pleasure in old age as in
youth. Defoe's amazing gift of invention does not compensate
for the want of a creative and elevating imagination.</p>

<p><i>The History of the Plague in London</i> (1722) stands next
to <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> in literary merit. Had Defoe been a
witness, as he pretends to have been, of the scenes which
he describes, the record could not be more vivid. It professes
to have been 'written by a citizen who continued
all the while in London,' and 'lived without Aldgate
Church and Whitechapel Bars, on the left hand or north
side of the street.' In this case, as in others, the circumstantial
character of the narrative led readers to regard it
as a true history, and Dr. Mead, in his <i>Discourse on the
Plague</i> (1744), quotes the book as an authority.</p>

<p>Highly characteristic of Defoe's style, and of his art as a
moralist is the <i>Religious Courtship</i>, also published in 1722.
It is the fictitious history of a family told partly in
dialogue, and so written as to attract the reader in spite
of repetitions and of reflections as praiseworthy as they are
commonplace. It appeals to a class whose attention would
not be won by fine literature, and has not appealed in vain,
for the book, after passing through a large number of
editions, has not yet lost its popularity. Morally the work
is unobjectionable, though not a little narrow, and it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
strange that it should have appeared about the same time
as a story so offensively coarse as <i>Moll Flanders</i>.</p>

<p>The most veracious book written by Defoe is <i>A Tour
through the Whole Island of Great Britain, By a Gentleman</i>,
1724, in three volumes. The full title of the work is too
long to quote, but it may be observed that the promises it
holds out under five headings are satisfactorily fulfilled.
The <i>Tour</i> bears the marks of having been written with great
care and from personal observation throughout. Defoe
states that before publishing the book he had made
seventeen large circuits or separate journeys, and three
general tours through the whole island. It contains
curious information as to the state of England and Scotland
one hundred and seventy years ago, and readers
interested in our social progress and the industrial life
of the country will find much to interest them in the
traveller's shrewd observations and careful details. The
love of mountain and lake scenery felt by Gray more than
forty years later was a passion unknown to Defoe and
to most of his contemporaries. In the <i>Tour</i> Westmoreland
is described as the wildest, most barbarous and frightful
country of any which the author had passed over. He
observes that it is 'of no advantage to represent horror,'
and the impassable hills with their snow-covered tops
'seemed,' he says, 'to tell us all the pleasant part of
England was at an end.' The <i>Tour</i> exhibits Defoe's
literary gift of expressing what he has to say in the
clearest language. A homely style which fulfils its purpose
has a merit deserving of recognition. For steady work
upon the road the sober hackney is of more service than
the race-horse.</p>

<p>Defoe was a husband and father and a man of affairs,
yet, like his own Crusoe, he lived a lonely life, and in 1731,
owing to some strange circumstance of which there is no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
record, died a lonely death at a lodging-house at Moorfields.
He has been called the father of the English novel,
and deserves the title, although on a slighter scale Steele
and Addison preceded him as writers of fiction. As a
novelist he is without refinement, without ideality, without
passion; he looks at life from a low level, but in
the narrow territory of which he is master&mdash;the art of
realistic invention&mdash;his power of insight is incontestible.
Defoe adopted a method dear in our day to some of the
least worthy of French novelists, who while aiming to copy
Nature debase her. For Nature must be interpreted by
Art, since only thus can we obtain a likeness that shall be
both beautiful and true. Defoe, nevertheless, has contributed
one book of lasting value to the literature of his
country, and such a gift, in the eyes of the literary
chronicler, hides a multitude of faults.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John Dennis
(1657-1733-4).</div>

<p>John Dennis was born in London and educated at
Harrow and Caius College, Cambridge. His
relations with Pope give him a more prominent
position among men of letters than he
would otherwise deserve, and mark with unpleasing distinctness
the coarse methods of literary warfare adopted in
Pope's day. The poet began the attack in his <i>Essay on
Criticism</i>. Dennis had written a tragedy called <i>Appius
and Virginia</i>, and Pope, who had a grudge against him
for not admiring his <i>Pastorals</i>, showed his spite in the
following lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'But Appius reddens at each word you speak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stares tremendous, with a threatening eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like some fierce tyrant in old tapestry.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was perilous in Pope to allude to the personal defects
of an antagonist, and Dennis attacked him coarsely in
return as a 'young, squab, short gentleman, an eternal
writer of amorous pastoral madrigals, and the very bow of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the god of Love.' 'He has reason,' he adds, 'to thank the
good gods that he was born a modern; for had he been
born of Grecian parents, and his father by consequence
had by law the absolute disposal of him, his life had been
no longer than one of his poems&mdash;the life of half a day.'</p>

<p>Dennis's pamphlet on the <i>Essay</i> caused Pope some pain
when he heard of it, 'But it was quite over,' he told
Spence, 'as soon as I came to look into his book and found
he was in such a passion.'</p>

<p>The critic, however, was a thorn in Pope's flesh for
many a year, and the poet showed his irritation by assaulting
him in prose and verse. Dennis was equally ready,
although not equally capable of returning the poet's blows,
and when free from the impotence of anger, made several
shrewd critical thrusts which his antagonist felt keenly.</p>

<p>Dennis aspired to be a poet and dramatist. He wrote a bombastic
poem in blank verse called <i>The Monument</i>, sacred to
the immortal memory of 'the good, the great, the god-like,
William III.'; a poem, also in blank verse, and still more
'tremendous,' to quote his favourite word, on the <i>Battle of
Blenheim</i>, in which he frequently invokes his soul to say
and sing a thousand things far beyond his soul's reach&mdash;and
a poem equally laboured and grandiloquent, on the
Battle of Ramillies, in which there are passages that read
like a burlesque of Milton. Dennis observes in his
<i>Grounds of Criticism in Poetry</i> (1704) that 'poetry unless
it pleases, nay, and pleases to a height, is the most contemptible
thing in the world.' This is just criticism, but
the writer did not recognize that his own verse was
contemptible. In this essay, which contains many sound
critical remarks and an appreciation of Milton seldom felt
at that time, he has the bad taste to quote as an illustration
of the sublime, a passage from his own paraphrase of
the Te Deum:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Where'er at utmost stretch we cast our eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the vast frightful spaces of the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ev'n there we find Thy glory, there we gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Thy bright Majesty's unbounded blaze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten thousand suns prodigious globes of light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once in broad dimensions strike our sight;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And still remoter flaming worlds descry;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Our vast conceptions are by swelling, brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swallowed and lost in Infinite, to nought.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is significant of Dennis's judgment of his own verse
that these inflated lines follow one of the loveliest passages
contained in <i>Paradise Lost</i>. Milton describes the moon
unveiling her peerless light; and the poet-critic exhibits
in juxtaposition his 'vigorous towering thoughts' about
the stars. The comparison forced upon the reader is
unfortunate.</p>

<p>His tragedies, <i>Iphigenia</i> (1704), <i>Liberty Asserted</i> (1704),
<i>Appius and Virginia</i> (1709), and a comedy called <i>A Plot
and No Plot</i> (1697) were brought upon the stage. <i>Liberty
Asserted</i>, which was received with applause due to the
violence of its attacks upon the French, although called a
tragedy, does not end tragically. The heroine's patriotism
is so fervid that she professes herself willing, while loving
one man, to marry another whom she does not love, if her
country deems him the more worthy.</p>

<p>Among other poetical attempts, Dennis addressed a
Pindaric Ode to Dryden, and the great poet, with the
flattery which he was always ready to lavish on his well-wishers,
called him 'one of the greatest masters' in that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
kind of verse. 'You have the sublimity of sense as well
as sound,' he wrote, 'and know how far the boldness of a
poet may lawfully extend.'</p>

<p>It may be added that Dennis on one occasion successfully
opposed one of the ablest controversialists of the age. In
<i>The Absolute Unlawfulness of Stage Entertainments fully
demonstrated</i>, William Law attacked dramatic representations,
not on account of the evils at that time associated
with them, but as 'in their own nature grossly sinful.'
'To suppose an innocent play,' Law says, 'is like supposing
innocent lust, sober rant, or harmless profaneness,' and
throughout the pamphlet this strain of fierce hostility is
maintained.</p>

<p>'Law,' says his biographer,'measured his strength with
some of the very ablest men of his day, with men like
Hoadly and Warburton, and Tindal and Wesley; and it
may safely be said that he never came forth from the
contest defeated. But, absurd as it may sound, it is
perfectly true that what neither Hoadly nor Warburton,
nor Tindal, nor Wesley could do, was done by John Dennis....
"Plays," wrote Law, "are contrary to Scripture as
the devil is to God, as the worship of images is to the
second commandment." To this Dennis gave the obvious
and unanswerable retort that "when St. Paul was at
Athens, the very source of dramatic poetry, he said a great
deal publicly against the idolatry of the Athenians, but not
one word against their stage. At Corinth he said as little
against theirs. He quoted on one occasion an Athenian
dramatic poet, and on others Aratus and Epimenides. He
was educated in all the learning of the Grecians, and could
not but have read their dramatic poems; and yet, so far
from speaking a word against them, he makes use of them
for the instruction and conversion of mankind."'</p>

<p>Dennis's pamphlet, <i>The Stage defended from Scripture,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Reason, Experience, and the Common Sense of Mankind for
Two Thousand Years</i>, was published in 1726. In his latter
days he suffered from two grievous calamities, poverty and
blindness. In 1733 Vanbrugh's play, <i>The Provoked Husband</i>,
was acted for his benefit, and his old enemy Pope
wrote the prologue, of which the sarcasm is more conspicuous
than the kindness. There is a story, to which
allusion is made in the <i>Dunciad</i>, that Dennis had invented
some kind of theatrical thunder, and how, being once present
at a tragedy, he fell into a great passion because his
art had been appropriated, and cried out ''Sdeath! that is
<i>my</i> thunder.' The critic was also known to have an intense
hatred of the French and of the Pope, and these peculiarities
are not forgotten in the prologue.</p>

<p>After saying that Dennis lay pressed by want and
weakness, his doubtful friend adds:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'How changed from him who made the boxes groan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shook the stage with thunders all his own!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood up to dash each vain Pretender's hope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maul the French tyrant, or pull down the Pope!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If there's a Briton then, true bred and born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who holds Dragoons and wooden shoes in scorn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If there's a critic of distinguished rage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If there's a senior who contemns this age;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him to-night his just assistance lend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be the Critic's, Briton's, Old Man's friend.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Dennis got £100 by this benefit, but had little time in
which to spend it, for he died about a fortnight afterwards
at the age of seventy-seven. Upon his death Aaron Hill
wrote some memorial verses, in which he prophesies that,
while the critic's frailties will be no longer remembered,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The rising ages shall redeem his name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nations read him into lasting fame.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It will be seen that the poets did not all treat Dennis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
unkindly. If praise were substantial food, he would have
had enough to sustain him from 'glorious John' alone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Colley Cibber
(1671-1757).</div>

<p>Colley Cibber holds a more prominent place than
Dennis in the list of men whom Pope selected
for attack. He could not have chosen one
more impervious to assault. The poet's
anger excited Cibber's mirth, his satire contributed to his
content. The comedian's unbounded self-satisfaction and
good humour, his vivacity and spirits, were proof against
Pope's malice. Graceless he may have been, but a dullard
the mercurial 'King Colley' was not.</p>

<p>Born in 1671, he disappointed the hopes of his father,
the famous sculptor, and at the age of eighteen made his
first appearance on the stage. As actor and as dramatist,
the theatre throughout his life was Cibber's all-absorbing
interest. His first play, <i>Love's Last Shift</i> (1696), kept possession
of the stage for forty years, and his best play, <i>The
Careless Husband</i> (1704), received a like welcome. As an
actor he was also successful, and played for £50 a night,
the highest sum ever given at that time to any English
player. His career was as long as it was prosperous. 'Old
Cibber plays to-night,' Horace Walpole wrote in 1741, 'and
all the world will be there.'</p>

<p>It was only as Poet Laureate, for he could not write
poetry, that Cibber displayed his inferiority. The honour
was conferred in 1730, two years after Gay had produced
the <i>Beggar's Opera</i>, when Pope was in the height of his
fame, when Thomson had published his <i>Seasons</i> and Young
<i>The Universal Passion</i>. Pope, as a Roman Catholic, was
out of the running, but there were poets living who would
have saved the office from the disgrace brought upon it by
Cibber. 'As to Cibber,' Swift wrote to Pope, 'if I had any
inclination to excuse the Court, I would allege that the
Laureate's place is entirely in the Lord Chamberlain's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
gift; but who makes Lord Chamberlains is another question.'
The sole result of the appointment that deserves
to be recorded is an epigram by Johnson, as just as it is
severe:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Augustus still survives in Maro's strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Spenser's verse prolongs Eliza's reign;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great George's acts let tuneful Cibber sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Nature formed the Poet for the King!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of poetry there is no trace in the five volumes of his
dramatic works; there are few touches of nature, and little
genuine wit, but these defects are to some extent supplied
by sparkling dialogue and lively badinage. Cibber is often
sentimental, and when he is sentimental he is odious. His
attempts to express strong emotion and honourable feeling
excite laughter instead of sympathy, and on this account it
is difficult to accept without some deduction Mr. Ward's
favourable judgment of <i>The Careless Husband</i>,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> which, if it
be one of the cleverest of Cibber's dramas, is also one of
the most conspicuous for this defect. Here, as elsewhere,
Cibber should have left sentiment alone. Imagine a lover
exclaiming to a relenting mistress, 'Oh, let my soul thus
bending to your power, adore this soft descending goodness!'
or a man conversing in the following strain with a
wife who has discovered and forgiven his infidelities:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i>Sir Charles.</i> Come, I will not shock your softness by
any untimely blush for what is past, but rather soothe you
to a pleasure at my sense of joy for my recovered happiness
to come. Give then to my new-born love what name you
please, it cannot, shall not be too kind. Oh! it cannot be
too soft for what my soul swells up with emulation to deserve.
Receive me then entire at last, and take what yet
no woman ever truly had, my conquered heart.</p>

<p>'<i>Lady Easy.</i> Oh, the soft treasure! Oh, the dear reward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
of long-desiring love&mdash;thus, thus to have you mine is
something more than happiness, 'tis double life and madness
of abounding joy....</p>

<p>'<i>Sir Charles.</i> Oh, thou engaging virtue! But I'm too
slow in doing justice to thy love. I know thy softness will
refuse me; but remember, I insist upon it&mdash;let thy woman
be discharged this minute.'</p></div>

<p>It has been said that Cibber wrote genteel comedy because
he lived in the best society. If this assertion be true,
the reader of his plays will decide that the best society of
those days was unrefined and immoral, and that genteel
comedy can be extremely vulgar. Cibber's dramas are
coarse in incident, and often offensive in suggestion. The
language is frequently gross, and even when he writes, or
professes to write, with a moral purpose, his method may
justly offend a rigid moralist. Moreover his comedy, like
that of the dramatists of the Restoration, is of a wholly
artificial type. Human nature has comparatively little
place in it, and the fine ladies and gentlemen, the fops and
fools who play their parts in his scenes, belong to a
world which has no existence off the boards of the theatre.</p>

<p>His one work which is still read by all students of the
drama, and by many who are not students, is the <i>Apology
for the Life of Mr. Colley Cibber</i> (1740), which Dr. Johnson,
who sneered at actors, allowed to be very entertaining.
It is that, and something more, for it contains much just
and generous criticism. Cibber was the author or adapter
of about thirty plays, and in the latter vocation did not
spare Shakespeare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lady Mary Wortley
Montagu (1689-1762).</div>

<p>Letter writing, a delightful branch of literature, attained
its highest excellence in the eighteenth
century. It is an art which gains
most, if the paradox may be allowed,
by being artless. The carefully studied epistle, written<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
with a view to publication, may have its value, but it cannot
have the charm of a letter written in the familiar intercourse
of friendship. It is the correspondence prompted
by the heart which reaches the heart of the reader. The
humour, the gaiety, the tenderness, and the chatty details
that make a letter attractive, should be prompted by the
feelings and events of the hour. Carefully constructed
sentences and rhetorical flourishes ring hollow; to write for
effect is to write badly, and to make a display of knowledge
is to reveal an ignorance of the art.</p>

<p>For letter writing, although the most natural of literary
gifts, is not wholly due to nature. It is the outcome of many
qualities which need cultivation; the soil that produces such
fruit must have been carefully tilled. In our day epistolary
correspondence has been in great measure destroyed by the
penny post and by rapidity of communication. In the
last century postage was costly: and although the burden
was frequently and unjustly lightened by franks, the
transmission of letters was slow and uncertain. Letters,
therefore, were seldom written unless the writer had
something definite to say, and had leisure in which to
say it. Much time was spent in the occupation, letters
were carefully preserved as family heirlooms, and thus
it has come to pass that much of our knowledge of the
age, and very much of the pleasure to be gained from
a study of the period, is due to its letter writers. The list
of them is a striking one, for it includes the names of Swift
and Steele, of Pope and Gay, of Bolingbroke and Chesterfield,
of Mrs. Delany and Mrs. Thrale, and of the three
gifted rivals in the art, Gray, Horace Walpole, and Cowper.</p>

<p>In the band of authors famous for their correspondence,
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu holds a conspicuous place.
Reference has been already made to the Pope correspondence,
large in bulk and large too in interest. To this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Lady Mary contributed slightly, and the greater portion of
her letters were addressed to her husband, to her sister,
Lady Mar, and to her daughter, the Countess of Bute.
She was shrewd enough to know their value: 'Keep my
letters,' she wrote, 'they will be as good as Madame de
Sévigné's forty years hence;' and they are, perhaps, as good
as letters can be which are written with a sense of their
value, which Madame de Sévigné's were not. Lady Mary,
who may be said to have belonged to the wits from
her infancy, for in her eighth year she was made the toast
of the Kit Kat Club, was not only a beauty, but a woman
of some learning and of the keenest intelligence. At
twenty she translated the <i>Encheiridion</i> of Epictetus. She
was a great reader and a good critic, unless, which often
happened, political prejudices warped her judgment. She
had considerable facility in rhyming, and both with tongue
and pen cultivated many enmities, the deadliest of her foes
being the poet who was at one time her most ardent
admirer. The story of Lady Mary's career, with its vicissitudes
and singularities, may be read in Lord Wharncliffe's
edition of her <i>Life and Letters</i>. She is a prominent figure
in the literature of the period, and made several passing
contributions to it, but apart from a few facile and far
from decent verses her letters are the sole legacy she has
left behind her for the literary student. Some of them,
and especially those addressed to her sister the Countess
of Mar, are often coarse; those to her daughter the Countess
of Bute exhibit good sense, and all abound in lively sallies,
interesting anecdotes, and the personal allusions which give
a charm to correspondence. The section containing the
letters written during her husband's embassy to Constantinople
(1716-1718) is perhaps the best known.</p>

<p>Among the strangest of Lady Mary's letters are those
addressed to her future husband, whom she requests to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
settle an annuity upon her in order to propitiate her friends.
In one of them she describes her father's purpose to marry
her as he thought fit without regarding her inclinations, and
observes that having declined to marry 'where it is impossible
to love,' she is bidden to consult her relatives: 'I told
my intention to all my nearest relations. I was surprised
at their blaming it to the greatest degree. I was told they
were sorry I would ruin myself; but if I was so unreasonable
they could not blame my F. [father] whatever he
inflicted on me. I objected I did not love him. They
made answer they found no necessity of loving; if I lived
well with him that was all was required of me; and that if
I considered this town I should find very few women in
love with their husbands and yet a many happy. It was
in vain to dispute with such prudent people.'</p>

<p>This incident is characteristic of the period, but Lady
Mary's letters to Wortley Montagu are more characteristic
of the woman who had her own views of female propriety,
and of the right method of love-making. To escape from
the man she hated, she eloped with Wortley, and if, in
story-book phrase, the curiously-matched couple 'lived
happily ever afterwards,' it was probably because for more
than twenty years they lived apart.</p>

<p>Of the following letter, written in her old age, it has
been aptly said that 'the graceful cynicism of Horace and
Pope has perhaps never been more successfully reproduced
in prose.'<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Daughter, daughter! Don't call names; You are always

true, but would be very ill received. We have all our

strength, and I forget my infirmities, we both attain very
desirable ends.'</p></div>

<p>Lady Mary, it may be added, deserves to be remembered
for her courage in trying inoculation on her own children,
and then introducing it into this country. This was in
1721, seventy-eight years before Jenner discovered a more
excellent way of grappling with the small pox.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Philip Dormer Stanhope
Earl of Chesterfield
(1694-1773).</div>

<p>Lord Chesterfield's position in the literature of the
period is also among the letter
writers. He was emphatically a
man of affairs, and as Lord Lieutenant
of Ireland in 1745, gained a
high reputation. He entered upon his labours with the
resolution to be independent of party, and during his brief
administration did all that man could do for the benefit of
the country. In his public career, Chesterfield has the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
reputation of an orator who spoke 'most exquisitely well;'
he was an able diplomatist, and probably no man of the
time took a wider interest in public affairs. In a corrupt
age, too, he appears to have been politically incorruptible:
'I call corruption,' he writes, 'the taking of a sixpence
more than the just and known salary of your employment
under any pretence whatsoever.' The reform of the
Calendar, in which he was assisted by two great mathematicians,
Bradley and the Earl of Macclesfield, is also one of
his honourable claims to remembrance.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Chesterfield, whom George II. called
'a tea-table scoundrel,' was an inveterate gambler, he mistook
vice for virtue, practised dissimulation as an art, and
studied men's weaknesses in order that he might flatter
them. One of the chief ends of man, in the Earl's opinion,
was to shine in society; we need not therefore wonder that
Johnson, with his sturdy honesty, revolted from Chesterfield's
insincerity, and we have to thank the Earl's character
for, perhaps, the noblest piece of invective in the
language. If, however, he neglected Johnson at the time
when his help would have been of service, he appreciated
the society of men of letters, and took his part among the
wits of the age. 'I used,' he tells his son, 'to think myself
in company as much above me when I was with Mr.
Addison and Mr. Pope as if I had been with all the princes
in Europe.'</p>

<p>As an essayist, although Chesterfield cannot compete
with Addison or Steele, he is far from contemptible, and
his twenty-three papers in the <i>World</i> (1753-1756) may still
be read with pleasure. His literary reputation is based
upon the <i>Letters</i> (1774)<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> to his illegitimate son written for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the purpose of making him a fine gentleman, but the young
man had no aptitude for the part. His father offered him
'a present of the Graces,' and he despised the gift. The
<i>Letters</i>, which Johnson denounced in language better fitted
for his day than for ours, abound in worldly sagacity and
wise counsels; the best that can be said of them from a
moral point of view is that they show the extremely low
standpoint of the writer. He is honestly desirous of benefiting
his son and advancing his interest in life, and so far
as morality will do this it is earnestly inculcated. 'A
real man of fashion,' he says, 'observes decency; at least
neither borrows nor affects vices; and, if he unfortunately
has any, he gratifies them with choice, delicacy and
secrecy.' He observes that an intrigue with a woman of
fashion is an amusement which a man of sense and decency
may pursue with a proper regard for his character; gallantry
without debauchery being 'the elegant pleasure of
a rational being.'</p>

<p>Chesterfield's son, who was educated for a diplomatist, is
told that the art of pleasing is more necessary in his profession
than perhaps in any other. 'Make your court
particularly, and show distinguished attentions to such
men and women as are best at Court, highest in the fashion
and in the opinion of the public; speak advantageously of
them behind their backs, in companies who you have
reason to believe will tell them again.'</p>

<p>The necessity for dissimulation, constantly enjoined
by his father was not forgotten by Philip Stanhope. So
effectually did he conceal his marriage that the Earl was
not aware of it until after his son's death.</p>

<p>George Lyttelton, afterwards Lord Lyttelton, has a place
among the poets in the collections of Anderson and
Chalmers. Some of his best verses were written when a
school-boy at Eton, and are worthy of a clever school-boy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
The <i>Monody</i> on his wife's death has the merit of sincere
feeling, expressed in one or two passages
poetically. In 1747 he published his <i>Dissertation
on the Conversion of St. Paul</i>, 'a
treatise,' says Dr. Johnson, 'to which infidelity has never
been able to fabricate a specious answer.' He made himself
conspicuous in parliament as an opponent of Walpole,
and after the fall of that minister was appointed one of the
Lords of the Treasury. In 1760 Lyttelton published his
<i>Dialogues of the Dead</i>, a volume for which he owes much to
Fénelon. This was followed a few years later by a History
of Henry II. in three volumes, upon which great labour
was expended. He is said to have had the whole history
printed twice over, and many sheets four or five times, an
amusement which cost him £1,000. The work is praised
by Mr. J. R. Green as 'a full and sober account of the
time.'</p>

<p>Lyttelton died at Hagley Park in his sixty-fourth year.
Close to Hagley, Shenstone had his little estate of the
Leasowes, and the poet is said to have cherished the
absurd fancy that Lord Lyttelton was envious of its beauty.
He is now chiefly remembered as the patron of Thomson,
whom he called 'one of the best and most beloved' of his
friends.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Joseph Spence
(1698-1768).</div>

<p>Joseph Spence, a warm friend and admirer of Pope
in the poet's later life, had the happy
peculiarity of keeping free from the party
animosities of the time. His course throughout
was that of a gentleman, and to him we owe the little
volume of <i>Anecdotes</i> which every student of Pope has
learnt to value. Spence had much of Boswell's curiosity
and hero-worship, but there is neither insight into character
in his pages, nor any trace of the dramatic skill
which makes Boswell's narrative so delightful. At the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
same time there is every indication that he strove to give
the sayings of the poet, as far as possible, in his own
words. Johnson and Warton saw the <i>Anecdotes</i> in manuscript,
but strange to say, the collection was not published
until 1820, when two separate editions appeared simultaneously.
The publication by Spence in 1727 of <i>An Essay
on Pope's Translation of Homer's Odyssey</i> led to an acquaintance
which soon became intimate between the poet
and his critic. Apart from literature, they had more than
one point of interest in common. Like Pope, Spence was
devoted to his mother, and like Pope he had a passion for
landscape gardening. His mild virtues and engaging disposition
are said to be portrayed in the <i>Tales of the Genii</i>,
under the character of Fincal the Dervise of the Groves.
In 1747 he published his <i>Polymetis, an Enquiry into the
agreement between the Works of the Roman Poets and the
Remains of Ancient Artists</i>. Under the <i>nom de plume</i> of
Sir Harry Beaumont, Spence produced a volume of <i>Moralities
or Essays, Letters, Fables and Translations</i> (1753), and
in the following year an account of the blind poet Blacklock.
For a learned tailor, Thomas Hill by name, he also
performed a similarly kind office, comparing him in <i>A
Parallel in the Manner of Plutarch</i> with the famous linguist
Magliabecchi. Spence was made Professor of Poetry at
Oxford in 1728, and held the post for ten years. His end
was a sad one. He was accidentally drowned in a canal in
the garden which he had loved so well.</p>

<h3>FRANCIS ATTERBURY&mdash;LORD SHAFTESBURY&mdash;BERNARD DE
MANDEVILLE&mdash;LORD BOLINGBROKE&mdash;BISHOP BERKELEY&mdash;WILLIAM
LAW&mdash;BISHOP BUTLER&mdash;BISHOP WARBURTON.</h3>


<div class="sidenote">Francis Atterbury
(1662-1732).</div>

<p>During the first half of the eighteenth century the position
held by Bishop Atterbury was one
of high eminence. Addison ranked him
with the most illustrious geniuses of his
age; Pope said he was one of the greatest men in polite
learning the nation ever possessed; Doddridge called him
the glory of English orators; and Johnson said that for
style his sermons are among the best.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Atterbury's literary gifts, like his oratory,
lack the merit of permanence, and his sermons, more conspicuous
for eloquence than for weightiness of matter,
although extremely popular at the time, have long ceased
to be read. His prominence among the Queen Anne wits,&mdash;and
he was admired by them all,&mdash;is a sufficient reason
for saying a few words about him in these pages.</p>

<p>He was born in 1662, and, like Prior, educated at Westminster
under the famous Dr. Busby. Thence he went to
Christ Church, Oxford, where he gained a good reputation.
He undertook the tutorship of the Hon. C. Boyle, a young
man of more spirit than judgment, who had the audacity
to enter the lists with Bentley in a matter of scholarship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
For this rash deed Atterbury must be held responsible.
Sir William Temple had published a foolish but eloquently
written essay in defence of the ancient writers in comparison
with the modern. In this essay he praises warmly
the <i>Letters of Phalaris</i>. Of these letters Boyle, with the
help of Atterbury and other members of Christ Church,
published a new edition to satisfy the demand caused by
Temple's essay. Bentley, roused to reply by a remark of
Boyle in his preface, proved that the <i>Letters</i> were not only
spurious but contemptible. Under his pupil's name Atterbury
replied to Bentley's <i>Dissertations</i>, and to the discussion,
as the reader will remember, Swift added wit if not
argument.</p>

<p>For the moment Boyle's, or rather Atterbury's success,
was great, for wit and rhetoric are powerful persuasives.
The authors, too, had the Christ Church men to back them,
the arch-critic having treated them with contempt. Atterbury's
share in the work, as he tells Boyle, "consisted in
writing more than half the book, in reviewing a great part
of the rest, and in transcribing the whole." His <i>Examination
of Dr. Bentley's Dissertations</i> (1698) is a brilliant piece
of work, and 'deserves the praise,' says Macaulay, 'whatever
that praise may be worth, of being the best book ever
written by any man on the wrong side of a question of
which he was profoundly ignorant.' Having taken holy
orders, Atterbury became a court preacher, and ample
clerical honours fell to his share. In 1700 he published
a book entitled, <i>The Rights, Powers, and Privileges of an
English Convocation Stated and Vindicated</i>, which was
warmly applauded by High Churchmen. In 1701 he was
appointed Archdeacon of Totness, and afterwards Prebend
of Exeter. He became the favourite chaplain of Queen
Anne, and when Prince George died proved the power of
his eloquence by representing 'his unassuming virtues in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
such high relief that his widow could not help feeling her
irreparable loss.'</p>

<p>Atterbury was made successively Dean of Carlisle and of
Christ Church, and in 1713 succeeded Sprat as Dean of
Westminster and Bishop of Rochester. Before making
Swift's acquaintance he recommended his friend Trelawney,
Bishop of Exeter, to read the <i>Tale of a Tub</i>, a book which
is to be valued, 'in spite of its profaneness,' as 'an original
in its kind, full of wit, humour, good sense, and learning.'
Atterbury's taste for literature was not always so discriminative.
He advised Pope, as has been already stated, to
'polish' <i>Samson Agonistes</i>, declared that all verses should
have instruction at the bottom of them, and told the poet,
as though he had discovered a merit, that his poetry was
'all over morality from the beginning to the end of it.'
He ventured occasionally into the verse-making field himself,
and wrote a song to Silvia, in which, after admitting
that he had loved before as men worship strange deities, he
adds:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'My heart, 'tis true, has often ranged,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like bees on gaudy flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a thousand loves has changed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till it was fixed on yours.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'But, Silvia, when I saw those eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Twas soon determined there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stars might as well forsake the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And vanish into air.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'When I from this great rule do err,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">New beauties to adore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May I again turn wanderer,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And never settle more.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The close friendship between Atterbury and Pope did
honour to both men, and when Pope went to London he
would 'lie at the deanery.' There, unknown to his friend,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
the bishop carried on his Jacobite intrigues, and there may
still be seen, in a residence made famous by more than
one great name, a secret room in which Atterbury concealed
his treasonable correspondence. The poet did not
believe that his friend was guilty, but it has been well
known since the publication of the Stuart papers, more
than forty years ago, that the splendid defence made by
Atterbury at his trial in the House of Lords was based upon
a falsehood. For years the bishop appears to have corresponded,
under feigned names and by the help of ciphers,
with 'the king over the water;' but the plot which led to
his imprisonment and ultimate exile was not discovered
until 1722, when he was arrested for high treason. At his
trial he called God to witness his innocence; and when
Pope took leave of him in the Tower he told the poet he
would allow him to call his sentence a just one if he should
ever find that he had dealings with the Pretender in his
exile. Pope gave evidence at his trial, and, as he told
Spence, lost his self-possession and made two or three
blunders.</p>

<p>Atterbury was exiled in June, 1723. On reaching Calais
he heard that Bolingbroke had just arrived there on his
way to England, having had a royal pardon. 'Then I am
exchanged,' he said.</p>

<p>The pathetic story of his banishment, and of his devoted
daughter's illness and voyage to the south of France,
where after a union of a few hours, she died in her father's
arms, is full of the most touching details, and may be
read in Atterbury's correspondence. 'She is gone,' the
bishop wrote, 'and I must follow her. When I do, may
my latter end be like hers! It was my business to have
taught her to die; instead of it, she has taught me.' Like
Fielding's account of his <i>Voyage to Lisbon</i>, the letters give
a picture of the time, and of travelling discomforts and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
difficulties of which we, in these more fortunate days, know
nothing. The bishop, who did not long survive his daughter,
died in 1732, but before the end came he defended himself
admirably from the accusation of Oldmixon, a libeller
who stands in the pillory of the <i>Dunciad</i>, that he had
helped to garble Clarendon's <i>History</i>. The body was
carried to England and privately buried by the side of
his daughter in Westminster Abbey. The eloquence of
Atterbury's sermons&mdash;there are four volumes of them in
print&mdash;has not secured to them a lasting place in literature,
but they are distinguished by purity of style, and have
enough of <i>unction</i> to make them highly effective as pulpit
discourses. In book form, too, they were for a long time
popular, and reached an eighth edition about thirty years
after the bishop's death. The eloquent sermon on the
death of Lady Cutts endows the lady with such an array
of virtues, that one is inclined to wonder how so many rare
qualities could have been exhibited in so brief a life:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'She excelled in all the characters that belonged to her,
and was in a great measure equal to all the obligations that
she lay under. She was devout without superstition; strict,
without ill humour; good-natured, without weakness; cheerful,
without levity; regular, without affectation. She was
to her husband the best of wives, the most agreeable of
companions, and most faithful of friends; to her servants
the best of mistresses; to her relations extremely respectful;
to her inferiors very obliging; and by all that
knew her, either nearly or at a distance, she was reckoned
and confessed to be one of the best of women. And yet all
this goodness and all this excellence was bounded within
the compass of eighteen years and as many days; for no
longer was she allowed to live among us. She was snatched
out of the world as soon almost as she had made her
appearance in it, like a jewel of high price just shown a
little, and then put up again, and we were deprived of her
by that time we had learnt to value her. But circles may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
be complete though small; the perfection of life doth not
consist in the length of it.'</p></div>

<p>As a friend of literature and of men of letters, Atterbury
claims the student's recognition, and the five volumes of
his correspondence deserve to be consulted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anthony, third
Lord Shaftesbury
(1671-1713).</div>

<p>'I will tell you,' writes the poet Gray, 'how Lord Shaftesbury
came to be a philosopher in vogue:
first, he was a lord; secondly, he was as
vain as any of his readers; thirdly, men
are very prone to believe what they do
not understand; fourthly, they will believe anything at all
provided they are under no obligation to believe it; fifthly,
they love to take a new road, even when that road leads
nowhere; sixthly, he was reckoned a fine writer, and seemed
always to mean more than he said. Would you have any
more reasons? An interval of above forty years has pretty
well destroyed the charm.'</p>

<p>One hundred and thirty-five years have gone by since
Gray wrote his estimate of Lord Shaftesbury, whose
<i>Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times</i> (1711)
passed through several editions in the last century. The
first volume consists of: <i>A Letter concerning Enthusiasm</i>,
<i>An Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humour</i> and <i>Advice
to an Author</i>; Vol. ii. contains <i>An Inquiry concerning
Virtue and Merit</i> (1699), and <i>The Moralists, a Philosophical
Rhapsody</i> (1709), and Vol. iii. contains <i>Miscellaneous Reflections</i>
and the <i>Judgments of Hercules</i>.</p>

<p>Shaftesbury was a Deist, and while professing to honour
the Christian faith, which he terms 'our holy religion,'
exercises his wit and casuistry and command of English to
undermine it. Pope, who shows in the <i>Essay on Man</i> that
he had read the <i>Characteristics</i>, said that to his knowledge
'the work had done more harm to revealed religion in
England than all the works of infidelity,' a judgment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
which may seem extravagant, for Shaftesbury is too
vague and rhetorical greatly to influence thoughtful
readers, and too much of a 'virtuoso,' to use his own
words, for readers of another class; yet the fact that the
work passed, as we have said, through several editions,
shows that the author had a considerable public to whom
he could appeal. Moreover, it is clear that what Mr.
Balfour calls 'the shallow optimism' of his creed was not
deemed so inconsiderable then as it now appears, or
Berkeley would not have deemed it necessary to controvert
his arguments in the third Dialogue of his <i>Alciphron</i>.
Like Berkeley, Shaftesbury occasionally makes use of the
dialogue very effectively, but he has not the bishop's
incisiveness. His style, though often faulty, and giving
one the impression that the author is affected, and wishes
to say fine things, is at its best fresh and lucid. The
reader will observe that whatever be the topic Shaftesbury
professes to discuss, his one aim is to assert his principles
as a free-thinking and free-speaking philosopher.
His inferences, his illustrations, his criticisms, and exaltation
of the 'moral sense,' are all so many underhanded
blows at the faith which he never openly opposes.</p>

<p>Thus his essay on the <i>Freedom of Wit and Humour</i> is
chiefly written in defence of raillery in the discussion of
serious subjects, when managed 'with good breeding,' and
for 'a liberty in decent language to question everything'
amongst gentlemen and friends. He regards ridicule as
the antidote to enthusiasm, believes in the harmony and
perfection of nature, and considers that evil only exists in
our ignorance. Mr. Leslie Stephen, whose impartiality in
estimating an author like Shaftesbury will not be questioned,
calls him a wearisome and perplexed writer, whose
rhetoric is flimsy, but who has 'a true vigour and originality
which redeems him from contempt.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>Judged by his influence on the age Shaftesbury's place
in the history of literature and of philosophy is an important
one. Seed springs up quickly when the soil is prepared
for it, and Shaftesbury by his belief in the perfectibility of
human nature through the aid of culture, appealed, as
Mandeville also did from a lower and opposite platform, to
the views current in polite society. According to Shaftesbury
men have a natural instinct for virtue, and the sense
of what is beautiful enables the virtuoso to reject what is
evil and to cleave to what is good. Let a man once see
that to be wicked is to be miserable, and virtue will be
dear for its own sake apart from the fear of punishment or
the hope of reward. He found salvation for the world in
a cultivated taste, but had no gospel for the men whose
tastes were not cultivated.</p>

<p>Voltaire sneered at the optimism of the <i>Essay on Man</i>
and of the <i>Characteristics</i>. 'Shaftesbury,' he says, 'who
made the fable fashionable, was a very unhappy man. I
have seen Bolingbroke a prey to vexation and rage, and
Pope, whom he induced to put this sorry jest into verse,
was as much to be pitied as any man I have ever known;
mis-shapen in body, dissatisfied in mind, always ill, always
a burden to himself, and harassed by a hundred enemies to
his very last moment.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bernard de Mandeville
(1670?-1733).</div>

<p>Bernard de Mandeville gained much notoriety by his
<i>Fable of the Bees, or Private Vices,
Public Benefits</i> (1723). The book
opens with a poem in doggrel verse
called <i>The Grumbling Hive, or Knaves turned honest</i>, the
purport of which is to show that as the bees became virtuous,
they ceased to be successful. He closes with the
moral that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'To enjoy the world's conveniences,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be famed in war, yet live in ease,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without great vices is a vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Utopia, seated in the brain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fraud, Luxury, and Pride must live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While we the benefits receive.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the prose which follows the fable, Mandeville may at
least claim the credit of being outspoken, and he does not
scruple to say that modesty is a sham and that what seems
like virtue is nothing but self-love. 'I often,' he says,
'compare the virtues of good men to your large china jars;
they make a fine show, but look into a thousand of them,
and you will find nothing in them but dust and cobwebs.'</p>

<p>While declaring that he is far from encouraging vice, he
regards it as essential to the well-being of society. The
degradation of the race excites his amusement, and the
fact that he cannot see a way of escape from it, causes no
regret. Shaftesbury's arguments excited the mirth of
a man who believed neither in present nor future good
'Two systems,' he says, 'cannot be more opposite than his
lordship's and mine. His notions, I confess, are generous
and refined. They are a high compliment to human
kind, and capable, by the help of a little enthusiasm, of
inspiring us with the most noble sentiments concerning the
dignity of our exalted nature. What pity it is that they
are not true.'</p>

<p>The author of the <i>Fable of the Bees</i> writes coarsely for
coarse readers, and the arguments by which he supports
his graceless theory merit the infamy generally awarded to
them.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The book was attacked by Warburton and Law, and
with much force and humour by Berkeley, in the second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Dialogue of <i>Alciphron</i>. But the bishop, to use a homely
phrase, does not hit the right nail on the head. Instead of
arguing that virtue and goodness are realities, while evil,
being unreal and antagonistic to man's nature, is an enemy
to be fought against and conquered, Berkeley takes a lower
ground, and is content to show in his reply to Mandeville
that virtue is more profitable to a state than vice. He
annihilates many of Mandeville's arguments in a masterly
style, but it was left to the author of the <i>Serious Call</i> to
strike at the root of Mandeville's fallacy, and to show how
the seat of virtue, if I may apply Hooker's noble words
with regard to law, 'is the bosom of God, her voice the
harmony of the world; all things in heaven and earth do
her homage, the very least as feeling her care, and the
greatest as not exempted from her power.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Bolingbroke
(1678-1751).</div>

<p>The life of Henry St. John was a mass of contradictions.
He was a brilliant politician who affected
to be a wise statesman, a traitor to his
country while pretending to be a patriot,
an orator whose lips distilled honied phrases which his
actions belied, a man of insatiable ambition who masked as
a philosopher, a profligate without shame, a faithless friend,
and an unscrupulous opponent. Blessed with every charm
of manner, features, and voice, with a taste for literature
and a large faculty of acquisition, he was a slave to the
meanest vices. A Secretary of State at thirty-two, no man
probably ever entered upon public life with brighter prospects,
and the secret of all his failures was due to the
want of character. 'Few people,' says Lord Hervey, 'ever
believed him without being deceived or trusted him without
being betrayed; he was one to whom prosperity was no
advantage, and adversity no instruction.'</p>

<p>It is said that his genius as an orator was of a high order
and this we can believe the more readily since the style of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
his works is distinctly oratorical. In speech so much
depends upon voice and manner that it is possible for a
shallow thinker to be an extremely attractive speaker;
Bolingbroke's speeches have not been preserved, and we
may therefore continue, if we please, to hold with Pitt, that
they are the most desirable of all the lost fragments of
literature; his writings, far more showy than solid, do not
convey a lofty impression of intellectual power. Obvious
truths and well-worn truisms are uttered in high-sounding
words, but in no department of thought can it be said that
Bolingbroke breaks new ground. Much that he wrote was
for the day and died with it, and if his more ambitious
efforts, written with an eye to posterity, cannot justly be
described as unreadable, they contain comparatively little
which makes them worthy to be read.</p>

<p>His defence of his conduct in <i>A Letter to Sir William
Windham</i>, written in 1717, but not published until after
the author's death, though worthless as a defence, is a fine
piece of special pleading in Bolingbroke's best style. It
could deceive no one acquainted with the part played by
the author before the death of Queen Anne, and afterwards
in exile, but it afforded him an opportunity for
attacking his former colleague, Oxford, with all the weapons
available by an unscrupulous and powerful assailant. He
declares in this letter that he preferred exile rather than to
make common cause with the man whom he abhorred.
Writing of Oxford as a colleague in the government of the
country he observes in a skilfully turned passage:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'The ocean which environs us is an emblem of our
government; and the pilot and the minister are in similar
circumstances. It seldom happens that either of them can
steer a direct course, and they both arrive at their port by
means which frequently seem to carry them from it. But
as the work advances the conduct of him who leads it on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
with real abilities clears up, the appearing inconsistencies
are reconciled, and when it is once consummated, the whole
shows itself so uniform, so plain, and so natural, that every
dabbler in politics will be apt to think he could have done
the same. But on the other hand the man who proposes
no such object, who substitutes artifice in the place of
ability, who, instead of leading parties and governing
accidents, is eternally agitated backwards and forwards by
both, who begins every day something new, and carries
nothing on to perfection, may impose awhile on the world:
but a little sooner or a little later the mystery will be
revealed, and nothing will be found to be couched under it
but a thread of pitiful expedients, the ultimate end of
which never extended farther than living from day to day.
Which of these pictures resembles Oxford most you will
determine.'</p></div>

<p>It has been said with somewhat daring exaggeration,
that Burke never produced anything nobler than this
passage, and the writer regards the whole composition of
the <i>Letter to Windham</i> as almost faultless.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>That it is Bolingbroke's masterpiece may be readily
admitted, but in this <i>Letter</i>, as elsewhere, the merits of
Bolingbroke's style are those of the popular orator who
conceals repetitions, contradictory statements, and emptiness
of thought under a dazzling display of rhetoric.
That he had splendid gifts and exhibited an extraordinary
ingenuity of resource was acknowledged by friend and
foe. At one time taking a distinguished part in European
affairs, at another artfully intriguing, sometimes posing as
a moralist and philosopher while a slave to debauchery, and
at other times affecting a love of retirement while a slave
to ambition&mdash;Bolingbroke acted a part which made him
one of the most conspicuous figures of the time. He knew
how to fascinate men of greater genius than he possessed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
and how to guide men intellectually his superiors. The
witchcraft of his wit and the charm of his manners no
longer disturb the judgment. As a statesman Bolingbroke
is now comparatively despised, as a man of letters he is
generally regarded as a brilliant pretender, and if his name
survives in the history of literature it is chiefly due to the
friendship of Pope. Unfortunately the memory of this
celebrated friendship is associated with one of the most
ignoble acts of Bolingbroke's life. When Pope lay dying,
Bolingbroke wept over his friend exclaiming, 'O great
God, what is man!' and Spence relates that upon telling
his lordship how Pope whenever he was sensible said something
kindly of his friends as if his humanity outlasted
his understanding, Bolingbroke replied, '"It has so! I
never in my life knew a man that had so tender a heart
for his particular friends or a more general friendship for
mankind. I have known him these thirty years, and value
myself more for that man's love than"&mdash;sinking his head
and losing himself in tears.' His sorrow was speedily
changed to anger. Pope, no doubt in admiration of his
friend's genius, had privately printed 1,500 copies of his
<i>Patriot King</i>, one of Bolingbroke's ablest but most sophistical
works. The philosopher had only allowed a few copies
to be printed for his friends, and the discovery of Pope's
conduct roused his indignation. In 1749 he put a corrected
copy of the work into Mallet's hands for publication with
an advertisement in which Pope is treated with contempt.
He had not the courage to assail the memory of his friend
openly, and hired an unprincipled man to do it. The poet had
acted trickily, after his wonted habit, though in all likelihood
with the design of doing Bolingbroke a service. It
was a fault to be forgiven by a friend, but Bolingbroke,
after nursing his anger for five years, gave vent to it in
this contemptible and underhand way. He died two years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
afterwards, and in 1754 the posthumous publication of
Bolingbroke's <i>Philosophical Writings</i> by Mallet, aroused a
storm of indignation in the country, which his debauchery
and political immorality had failed to excite. Johnson's
saying on the occasion is well-known:</p>

<p>'Sir, he was a scoundrel and a coward; a scoundrel for
charging a blunderbuss against religion and morality; a
coward because he had not resolution to fire it off himself,
but left half-a-crown to a beggarly Scotchman to draw the
trigger after his death.'</p>

<p>The most noteworthy estimate of Bolingbroke's character
made in our day comes from the pen of Mr. John Morley,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
who describes as follows his position as a man of letters.
'He handled the great and difficult instrument of written
language with such freedom and copiousness, such vivacity
and ease, that in spite of much literary foppery and
falsetto, he ranks in all that musicians call execution, only
below the three or four highest masters of English prose.
Yet of all the characters in our history Bolingbroke must
be pronounced to be most of a charlatan; of all the writing
in our literature, his is the hollowest, the flashiest, the
most insincere.' This is true. By his 'execution,' consummate
though it be, he is unable to conceal his insincerity
and shallowness. 'Bolingbroke,' said Lord Shelburne, was
'all surface,' and in that sentence his character is written.</p>

<p>'People seem to think,' said Carlyle, 'that a style can
be put off or put on, not like a skin, but like a coat. Is
not a skin verily a product and close kinsfellow of all that
lies under it,&mdash;exact type of the nature of the beast, not to
be plucked off without flaying and death?'</p>

<p>Two years after the publication of the <i>Philosophical
Writings</i>, Edmund Burke, then a young man of twenty-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>four,
published <i>A Vindication of Natural Society</i>, in a
<i>Letter to Lord&mdash;&mdash;. By a late noble writer</i>, in which
Lord Bolingbroke's style is imitated, and his arguments
against revealed religion applied to exhibit 'the miseries
and evils arising to mankind from every species of Artificial
Society.' So close is the imitation of Bolingbroke's style
and mode of argument in this piece of irony, that it was
for a time believed to be a genuine production, and Mallet
found it necessary to disavow it publicly.</p>

<p>Of Bolingbroke's Works, the <i>Dissertation on Parties</i> appeared
in 1735. <i>Letters on Patriotism</i>, and <i>Idea of a
Patriot King</i>, in 1749; <i>Letters on the Study of History</i>, in
1752; <i>Letter to Sir W. Windham</i>, 1753, and the <i>Philosophical
Writings</i>, as already stated, in 1754. Chronologically,
therefore, he would belong to the Handbook which deals
with the latter half of the century, were it not that his
most important works were posthumous, and that Bolingbroke's
intimate relations with Pope place him among
the most conspicuous figures belonging to Pope's age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">George Berkeley
(1685-1753).</div>

<p>Among the men of high intellect who flourished in the
age of Pope, George Berkeley is one of the
most distinguished. Born in 1685 of
poor parents, in a cottage near Dysert
Castle, in Kilkenny, he went up to Trinity College, Dublin,
in 1700, and there, first as student, and afterwards as
tutor, he remained for thirteen years. In the course of
them he was ordained, and gained a fellowship. In 1709
he published his <i>Essay on Vision</i>, and in the following
year the <i>Principles of Human Knowledge</i>, works which
thus early made him famous as a philosopher, and a puzzle
to many who failed to understand his 'new principle'
with regard to the existence of matter.</p>

<p>In 1712 Berkeley visited England, probably for the first
time, and was introduced to the London wits. Already in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
these youthful days there was in him much of that magic
power which some men exercise unconsciously and irresistibly.
Swift felt the spell, called Berkeley a great philosopher,
and spoke of him to all the Ministers; while Atterbury,
upon being asked what he thought of him, exclaimed:
'So much understanding, so much knowledge, so much
innocence, and such humility, I did not think had been
the portion of any but angels till I saw this gentleman.'
An incident occurred, it is conjectured during the course
of this visit, which led to memorable results. He dined
once with Swift at Mrs. Vanhomrigh's, and met her
daughter Hester. Many years later, <i>Vanessa</i> destroyed
the will she had made in Swift's favour, and left half
of her property to Berkeley. While in London the future
bishop was warmly welcomed by Steele, and wrote
several essays for him in the <i>Guardian</i> against the Freethinkers,
and especially against Anthony Collins (1676-1729),
whose arguments in his <i>Discourse on Freethinking</i>
(1713) are ridiculed in the <i>Scriblerus Memoirs</i>. Collins,
it may be observed here, wrote a treatise several years
later on the <i>Grounds of the Christian Religion</i> (1724)
which called forth thirty-five answers. During this visit
Berkeley also published one of his most original works,
<i>Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous</i>, a book marked by
that consummate beauty of style for which he is distinguished.</p>

<p>In November, 1713, the Earl of Peterborough was sent
on an embassage to the King of Sicily, and on Swift's
recommendation took Berkeley with him as his chaplain
and secretary. Ten months were spent on this occasion
in France and Italy. Another continental tour followed,
in the course of which Berkeley wrote to Arbuthnot of his
ascent of Vesuvius, and to Pope of his life at Naples. Five
years were spent abroad, and he returned to England to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
learn of the failure of the South Sea Scheme. In his <i>Essay
towards Preventing the Ruin of Great Britain</i> (1721), the
main argument is the obvious one, that national salvation
is only to be secured by individual uprightness. He deplores
'the trifling vanity of apparel' which we have learned
from France, advocates the revival of sumptuary laws, considers
that we are 'doomed to be undone' by luxury, and
by the want of public spirit, and declares that 'neither
Venice nor Paris, nor any other town in any part of the
world ever knew such an expensive ruinous folly as our
masquerade.'</p>

<p>In the summer of this year he was again in London,
and Pope asked him to spend a week in his 'Tusculum.'
One promotion followed another until Berkeley became
Dean of Derry, with an income of from £1,500 to £2,000
a year. He did not hold this dignified position long, having
conceived the magnificent but Utopian idea of founding
a Missionary College in the Bermudas&mdash;the 'Summer Isles'
celebrated in the verse of Waller and of Marvell&mdash;for the
conversion of America.</p>

<p>And now Berkeley exhibited his amazing power of influencing
other men. The members of the Scriblerus
Club laughed at the Dean's project, but so powerful was
his eloquence, that 'those who came to scoff remained
to subscribe.' Moreover, with Sir Robert Walpole as
Prime Minister, he actually obtained a grant from the
State of £20,000 in order to carry out the project, the
king gave a charter, and to crown all, Sir Robert put
his own name down for £200 on the list of subscribers.
'The scheme,' says Mr. Balfour, 'seems now so impracticable
that we may well wonder how any single person, let
alone the representatives of a whole nation, could be found
to support it. In order that religion and learning might
flourish in America, the seeds of them were to be cast in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
some rocky islets severed from America by nearly six hundred
miles of stormy ocean. In order that the inhabitants
of the mainland and of the West Indian colonies might
equally benefit by the new university, it was to be placed in
such a position that neither could conveniently reach it.'<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
Berkeley, who had recently married, left England for
Rhode Island, where he stayed for about three years and
wrote <i>Alciphron</i> (1732), in which he attacks the freethinkers
under the title of <i>Minute Philosophers</i>. Then on
learning from Walpole that the promised money 'would
most undoubtedly be paid as soon as suits public convenience'
which would be never, he returned to England, and
through the Queen's influence was made Bishop of Cloyne.
In that diocese eighteen years of his life were spent. In the
course of them he published the <i>Querist</i> (1735-1737), an
<i>Essay on the Social State of Ireland</i> (1744), and, in the
same year, <i>Siris</i>, which contains the bishop's famous recipe
for the use of tar water followed by much philosophical
disquisition. The remedy, which was afterwards praised
by the poet Dyer in <i>The Fleece</i>, became instantly popular.
'We are now mad about the water,' Horace Walpole wrote;
'the book contains every subject from tar water to the
Trinity; however, all the women read it, and understand it
no more than if it were intelligible.' Editions of <i>Siris</i>
followed each other in rapid succession, and it was translated
into French and German. The work is that of an
enthusiast, and it should be read not for its argument, but
for its wealth of suggestiveness, and for what Mr. Balfour
calls 'a certain quality of moral elevation and speculative
diffidence alien both to the literature and the life of the
eighteenth century.' Berkeley had himself the profoundest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
faith in the panacea which he advocated. 'From my
representing tar water,' he writes, 'as good for so many
things, some, perhaps, many conclude it is good for nothing.
But charity obligeth me to say what I know, and what I
think, howsoever it may be taken. Men may conjecture and
object as they please, but I appeal to time and experience.'</p>

<p>In his latter days Berkeley, feeling his health failing,
desired to resign his bishopric and retire to Oxford, and
there&mdash;while still bishop of Cloyne, for the king would not
accept his resignation&mdash;the philosopher, who was blest, to
use Shakespeare's fine epithet, with a 'tender-hefted
nature,' passed away in 1753, leaving behind him one of
the most fragrant of memories.</p>

<p>That Berkeley was a philosophical thinker from his
earliest manhood is evident from his <i>Commonplace Book</i>
published for the first time in the Clarendon Press edition
of his works (vol. iv., pp. 419-502).</p>

<p>He delighted in recondite thought as much as most
young men delight in action, and as a philosopher he is
said to have commenced his studies with Locke, whose
famous <i>Essay</i> appeared in 1690. Of Plato, too, Berkeley
was an ardent admirer, and the spirit of Plato pervades his
works. His <i>Essay towards a New Theory of Vision</i> contains
some intimations of the famous metaphysical theory
which was developed a little later in the <i>Treatise on Human
Knowledge</i>.</p>

<p>A good deal of foolish ridicule was excited by this book.
Berkeley was supposed to maintain the absurd paradox
that sensible things do not exist at all. The reader will
remember how Dr. Johnson undertook to refute the postulate
by striking his foot against a stone, while James
Beattie (1735-1803), the poet and moral philosopher,
in a volume for which he was rewarded with a pension
of £200 a year, denounced Berkeley's philosophy as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
'scandalously absurd.' 'If,' he writes, 'I were permitted
to propose one clownish question, I would fain ask ...
Where is the harm of my believing that if I were to
fall down yonder precipice and break my neck, I should
be no more a man of this world? My neck, Sir, may be
an idea to you, but to me it is a reality, and a very
important one too. Where is the harm of my believing
that if in this severe weather I were to neglect to throw
(what you call) the idea of a coat over the ideas of my
shoulders, the idea of cold would produce the idea of such
pain and disorder as might possibly terminate in my real
death? What great offence shall I commit against God or
man, church or state, philosophy or common sense if I
continue to believe that material food will nourish me,
though the idea of it will not, that the real sun will warm
and enlighten me, though the liveliest idea of him will do
neither; and that if I would obtain here peace of mind
and self-approbation, I must not only form ideas of compassion,
justice and generosity, but also really exert those
virtues in external performance?'<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Beattie continues in this foolish strain to throw contempt
upon a system which he had not taken the trouble
to understand, and upon one of the sanest and noblest of
English philosophers, and he does so without a thought
that the absurdity is due to his own ignorance and not to
the theory of Berkeley. The author of the <i>Minstrel</i> was
an honest man and a respectable poet, but he prided himself
too much on what he called common sense, and failed
to see that in the search after truth other and even higher
faculties may be also needed. Moreover, Berkeley, so far
from being an enemy to common sense, endeavours, as he
says, to vindicate it, although in so doing, he 'may per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>haps
be obliged to use some <i>ambages</i> and ways of speech not
common.' A significant passage may be quoted from the
<i>Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous</i> (1713) in
illustration of his method and style so far indeed as a short
extract can illustrate an argument sustained by a long
course of reasoning.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i>Phil.</i> As I am no sceptic with regard to the nature of
things, so neither am I as to their existence. That a thing
should be really perceived by my senses, and at the same
time not really exist is to me a plain contradiction; since I
cannot prescind or abstract even in thought, the existence
of a sensible thing from its being perceived. Wood, stones,
fire, water, flesh, iron, and the like things, which I name
and discourse of, are things that I know. And I should
not have known them but that I perceived them by my
senses; and things perceived by the senses are immediately
perceived; and things immediately perceived are ideas;
and ideas cannot exist without the mind; their existence
therefore consists in being perceived; when therefore they
are actually perceived there can be no doubt of their
existence.... I might as well doubt of my own being, as
of the being of those things I actually see and feel.</p>

<p>'<i>Hyl.</i> Not so fast, <i>Philonous</i>; you say you cannot conceive
how sensible things should exist without the mind.
Do you not?</p>

<p>'<i>Phil.</i> I do.</p>

<p>'<i>Hyl.</i> Supposing you were annihilated, cannot you conceive
it possible that things perceivable by sense may still
exist?</p>

<p>'<i>Phil.</i> I can; but then it must be in another mind.
When I deny sensible things an existence out of the
mind, I do not mean my mind in particular, but all minds.
Now, it is plain they have an existence exterior to my
mind; since I find them by experience to be independent
of it. There is therefore some other mind wherein they
exist, during the intervals between the times of my perceiving
them; as likewise they did before my birth, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
would do after my supposed annihilation. And as the
same is true with regard to all other finite created spirits,
it necessarily follows there is an <i>omnipresent, eternal Mind</i>,
which knows and comprehends all things, and exhibits
them to our view in such a manner, and according to such
rules, as He Himself hath ordained, and are by us termed
the <i>Laws of Nature</i>.'</p>

<p>'Truth is the cry of all,' says Berkeley in the final paragraph
of <i>Siris</i>, 'but the game of a few. Certainly, where
it is the chief passion, it doth not give way to vulgar cares
and views, nor is it contented with a little ardour, active
perhaps to pursue, but not so fit to weigh and revise. He
that would make a real progress in knowledge, must dedicate
his age as well as youth, the latter growth as well as
firstfruits at the altar of truth.'</p></div>

<p>Elsewhere in this famous treatise he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'It cannot be denied that with respect to the universe of
things we in this mortal state are like men educated in
Plato's cave, looking on shadows with our backs turned to
the light. But though our light be dim and our situation
bad, yet if the best use be made of both, perhaps something
may be seen. Proclus, in his commentary on the
theology of Plato, observes there are two sorts of philosophers.
The one placed body first in the order of beings,
and made the faculty of thinking depend thereupon, supposing
that the principles of all things are corporeal; that
body most really or principally exists, and all other things
in a secondary sense and by virtue of that. Others making
all corporeal things to be dependent upon soul or mind,
think this to exist in the first place, and primary senses and
the being of bodies to be altogether derived from, and presuppose
that of the mind.'</p></div>

<p>This was Berkeley's creed, and his great aim throughout
is to prove the phenomenal nature of the things of sense,
or in other words the non-existence of independent matter.
He makes, he says, not the least question that the things
we see and touch really exist, but what he does question is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
the existence of matter apart from its perception to the
mind. Hobbes said that the body accounted for the mind,
and that matter was the deepest thing in the universe,
while to Berkeley the only true reality consists in what is
spiritual and eternal.</p>

<p>'The great idealist,' says an able writer, 'certainly never
denied the existence of matter in the sense in which Johnson
understood it. As the touched, the seen, the heard, the
smelled, the tasted, he admitted and maintained its existence
as readily and completely as the most illiterate
and unsophisticated of mankind,' and he adds that the
peculiar endowment for which Berkeley was distinguished
'far beyond his predecessors and contemporaries, and far
beyond almost every philosopher who has succeeded him,
was the eye he had <i>for facts</i>, and the singular pertinacity
with which he refused to be dislodged from his hold upon
them.'<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Pope's age produced a few great masters of style, and
among them Berkeley holds an undisputed place. He
succeeded, too, in the most difficult department of intellectual
labour, since to express abstruse thought in
language as beautiful as it is clear is the rarest of gifts.</p>

<p>'His works are beyond dispute the finest models of
philosophic style since Cicero. Perhaps they surpass those
of the orator, in the wonderful art by which the fullest
light is thrown on the most minute and evanescent parts
of the most subtle of human conceptions.'<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">William Law
(1686-1761).</div>

<p>William Law was born in 1686 at King's Cliffe in
Northamptonshire, and entered Emmanuel
College, Cambridge, as a Sizar in 1705. He
obtained a Fellowship, and received holy
orders in 1711, but having made a speech offensive to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
heads of houses, he was degraded. Law believed in the
divine right of kings, and on the death of Queen Anne,
declared his principles as a non-juror. In 1717 he published
his first controversial work, <i>Three Letters to the
Bishop of Bangor</i>; Hoadly, the famous bishop, having, in his
opponent's judgment, uttered lax and latitudinarian views
with regard to the Church of which he was one of the chief
pastors. These <i>Letters</i> have been highly praised for wit as
well as for argument, and Dean Hook, writing of the Bangorian
Controversy in his <i>Church Dictionary</i>, states that
'Law's <i>Letters</i> have never been answered and may, indeed,
be regarded as unanswerable.' Law was also the most
powerful assailant of Warburton's <i>Divine Legation</i>, which
he opposed with a burning zeal that was not always wise.
But as a controversialist he was an infinitely stronger
man than his opponent, and unlike Warburton, he never
debased controversy by scurrility, which the bishop generally
found a more potent weapon than argument.</p>

<p>On the publication, in 1723, of Dr. Mandeville's <i>Fable of
the Bees</i>, it was vigorously attacked by Law. In this
masterly pamphlet, instead of attempting to refute the
physician by showing that virtue is more profitable to the
State than vice, and that, therefore, private vices are not
public benefits, Law takes a higher ground, and asserts
that morality is not a question of profit and loss, but of
conscience. Mandeville maintains that man is a mere
animal governed by his passions; his opponent, on the
other hand, argues that man is created in the image of
God, that virtue 'is a law to which even the divine
nature is subject,' and that human nature is fitted to rise
to the angels, while Mandeville would lower it to the
brutes.</p>

<p>John Sterling, writing to F. D. Maurice of the first
section of Law's remarks, says: 'I have never seen in our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
language the elementary grounds of a rational ideal
philosophy, as opposed to empiricism, stated with nearly
the same clearness, simplicity, and force,' and it was at
Sterling's suggestion that Maurice published a new edition
of Law's argument with an introductory essay (1844).</p>

<p>The following passage from the <i>Remarks on the Fable of
the Bees</i> will illustrate Law's method as a polemic:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Deists and freethinkers are generally considered as
unbelievers; but upon examination they will appear to be
men of the most resigned and implicit faith in the world;
they would believe <i>transubstantiation</i>, but that it implies
a believing in God; for they never resign their reason, but
when it is to yield to something that opposes salvation.
For the Deist's creed has as many articles as the Christian's,
and requires a much greater suspension of our reason to
believe them. So that if to believe things upon no authority,
or without any reason, be an argument of credulity, the
freethinker will appear to be the most easy, credulous
creature alive. In the first place, he is to believe almost
all the same articles to be false which the Christian believes
to be true.</p>

<p>'Now, it may easily be shown that it requires stronger
acts of faith to believe these articles to be false, than to
believe them to be true. For, taking faith to be an assent
of the mind to some proposition, of which we have no
certain knowledge, it will appear that the Deist's faith is
much stronger, and has more of credulity in it, than the
Christian's. For instance, the Christian believes the
resurrection of the dead, because he finds it supported by
such evidence and authority as cannot possibly be higher,
supposing the thing was true; and he does no more
violence to his reason in believing it, than in supposing
that God may intend to do some things, which the reason
of man cannot conceive how they will be effected.</p>

<p>'On the contrary, the Deist believes there will be no
resurrection. And how great is his faith, for he pretends
to no evidence or authority to support it; it is a pure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
naked assent of his mind to what he does not know to be
true, and of which nobody has, or can give him, any full
assurance. So that the difference between a Christian and
a Deist does not consist in this, that the one assents to
things unknown, and the other does not; but in this, that
the Christian assents to things unknown on account of
evidence; the other assents to things unknown without
any evidence at all. Which shows that the Christian is
the rational believer and the Deist the blind bigot.'</p></div>

<p>It is probable that Law, like other writers on the
orthodox side, did not sufficiently take into account the
service rendered by the Deists in arousing a spirit of
inquiry. Free-thinking is right thinking, and 'it was a
result of the Deistic controversy, which went far to make
up many evils in it, that in the end it widened and enlarged
Christian thought.'<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The author's next and weakest work, <i>On the Unlawfulness
of Stage Entertainments</i> (1726), is mentioned elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>In the same year he published <i>Christian Perfection</i>,
a profoundly earnest but puritanically narrow work, in
which our earthly life is regarded simply as the road to
another. 'There is nothing that deserves a serious thought,'
he writes, 'but how to get out of the world and make it a
right passage to our eternal state.' No man ever practised
what he preached with more sincerity and persistency than
William Law, but it can hardly be doubted that he narrowed
the range of his influence by the views he expressed
with regard to culture and to all human learning. He
forgot that, without the logic, the wit, the irony, the
singular force and lucidity of style displayed in his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
writings, he would have lost the power as a religious
teacher which he was so eager to exercise.</p>

<p>Literature <i>quâ</i> literature Law regarded with contempt,
and he is said to have looked upon the study even of
Milton as waste of time. Yet his biographer states what
seems likely enough, considering the fine qualities of Law's
own writings, that 'no author was ever a favourite with
him, unless he was a man of literary merit.'</p>

<p>In 1727, and probably before that date, Law held the
position of tutor to Edward Gibbon, whose famous son,
the historian, in his <i>Autobiography</i>, gives to him the high
praise of having left in the family 'the reputation of a
worthy and pious man, who believed all that he professed,
and practised all that he enjoined.'</p>

<p>Law accompanied his pupil to Cambridge, and it is conjectured
that during this residence at the university he
wrote what Gibbon justly called his 'master work,' <i>A
Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life</i> (1729), the most
impressive book of its class produced in the eighteenth
century. The historian's father was a man of feeble
character. He left Cambridge without a degree, and went
on his travels, the tutor meanwhile remaining in the family
house at Putney, where he seems to have gathered round
him a number of disciples.</p>

<p>The <i>Serious Call</i> had an immediate and strong influence
on many thoughtful men, and Law's book stimulated in no
common measure the religious life of the country. John
Wesley spoke of it as a treatise hardly to be excelled in
the English tongue 'either for beauty of expression, or for
justness and depth of thought.' Whitefield, Venn, and
Thomas Scott, the commentator, acknowledged their indebtedness
to the work, and Dr. Johnson, speaking of his
youthful days, said: 'I became a sort of lax <i>talker</i> against
religion, for I did not much <i>think</i> against it; and this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
lasted till I went to Oxford, when I took up Law's <i>Serious
Call to a Holy Life</i>, expecting to find it a dull book (as
such books generally are), but I found Law quite an over-match
for me; and this was the first occasion of my
thinking in earnest.' The first Lord Lyttelton, the historian
and friend of Thomson, is said to have taken up the book
one night at bed-time, and to have read it through before
he went to bed; but, perhaps, the most unimpeachable
evidence in its favour comes from the pen of Gibbon, who
writes: 'Mr. Law's precepts are rigid, but they are founded
on the Gospel. His satire is sharp, but it is drawn from
the knowledge of human life, and many of his portraits are
not unworthy of the pen of La Bruyère. If he finds a
spark of piety in his reader's mind he will soon kindle it
to a flame.'</p>

<p>Law's art as a portrait painter will be seen in the following
sketch of Flavia:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i>Flavia</i> would be a miracle of piety if she was but half
so careful of her soul as she is of her body. The rising of
a <i>pimple</i> on her face, the sting of a gnat, will make her keep
her room two or three days, and she thinks they are very
rash people that do not take care of things in time. This
makes her so over careful of her health that she never
thinks she is well enough, and so over indulgent that she
never can be really well. So that it costs her a great deal
in sleeping draughts and waking draughts, in spirits for
the head, in drops for the nerves, in cordials for the stomach,
and in saffron for her tea.</p>

<p>'If you visit <i>Flavia</i> on the Sunday, you will always meet
good company, you will know what is doing in the world,
you will hear the last lampoon, be told who wrote it, and
who is meant by every name that is in it. You will hear
what plays were acted that week, which is the finest song
in the opera, who was intolerable at the last assembly, and
what games are most in fashion. <i>Flavia</i> thinks they are
atheists who play at cards on the Sunday, but she will tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
you the nicety of all the games, what cards she held, how
she played them, and the history of all that happened at
play, as soon as she comes from church. If you would
know who is rude and ill-natured, who is vain and foppish,
who lives too high and who is in debt; if you would know
what is the quarrel at a certain house, or who and who are in
love; if you would know how late Belinda comes home at
night, what clothes she has bought, how she loves compliments,
and what a long story she told at such a place; if
you would know how cross Lucius is to his wife, what ill-natured
things he says to her, when nobody hears him; if
you would know how they hate one another in their hearts
though they appear so kind in public; you must visit
<i>Flavia</i> on the Sunday. But still she has so great a regard
for the holiness of the Sunday, that she has turned a poor
old widow out of her house as a <i>profane wretch</i>, for having
been found once mending her clothes on the Sunday
night.'</p></div>

<p>Between the years 1733-37, owing to his acquaintance
with the writings of the famous mystic, Jacob Boehme,
Law became a mystic himself. The 'blessed Jacob' as he
calls him exercised an influence which colours all his later
writings and lasted till his death. In 1740 he retired
to his native village and to solitude; but after a while two
wealthy and devout ladies, one of them a widow, the other
the historian's aunt, Miss Hester Gibbon, joined him in his
retreat and devoted to charitable objects their labours and
their fortunes. 'Out of a joint income of not less than
three thousand pounds a year, only about three hundred
pounds were spent upon the frugal expenses of the household
and the simple personal wants of the three inhabitants.
The whole of the remainder was spent upon the poor.'<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
Report says, let us hope it may be scandal, that after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the master's death the love of earthly vanities revived
in two of his pupils. His favourite niece had a new dress
every month, and Miss Gibbon 'appeared resplendent in
yellow stockings.' This is not the place to follow Law's
self-denying career, neither are we concerned with the
volumes which contain his later views. Admirably written
though they be, these works do not belong to the field of
literature. Law lived in vigour both of mind and body to
a good old age, and died in 1761.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Joseph Butler
(1692-1752).</div>

<p>Joseph Butler, whose <i>Sermons</i> (1726), and <i>Analogy of
Religion Natural and Revealed to the Constitution
and Course of Nature</i> (1736), are among
the highest contributions to theology produced
in the last century, called the imagination 'a forward,
delusive faculty,' and he could have boasted that it was a
faculty of which no trace is to be found in his works.
Moreover, he is generally regarded as wholly destitute
of style, and in a sense this is true, for Butler is so intent
upon what he has to say that he cares little how he says it.
His sense of beauty if he possessed it, was absorbed in a
supreme allegiance to truth, and his life was that of
a Christian philosopher intent upon one object. His
sermons, preached at the Rolls Chapel, which contain the
germ of his philosophy, are too closely packed with argument
and too recondite in thought to fit them for pulpit discourses.
The <i>Analogy</i>, which occupied seven years of
Butler's life, is better known and more generally interesting.
'There is,' he says, 'a much more exact correspondence
between the natural and the moral world than we are
apt to take notice of.' His aim is to show that the difficulties
which meet us in Revelation are to be found also in
nature, that as our happiness or misery in this world largely
depends upon conduct, so it is reasonable to suppose, apart
from what Revelation teaches, that we are also in a state of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
probation with regard to a future life. As youth is an
education for mature age, so may the whole of our earthly
life be an education for a future existence.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'And if we were not able at all to discern how or in
what way the present life could be our preparation for
another, this would be no objection against the credibility
of its being so. For we do not discern how food and sleep
contribute to the growth of the body; nor could have any
thought that they would before we had experience. Nor
do children at all think on the one hand that the sports and
exercises, to which they are so much addicted, contribute to
their health and growth; nor, on the other, of the necessity
which there is for their being restrained in them; nor are
they capable of understanding the use of many parts of
discipline, which, nevertheless, they must be made to go
through in order to qualify them for the business of mature
age. Were we not able, then, to discover in what respects
the present life could form us for a future one, yet nothing
would be more supposable than that it might, in some
respects or other, from the general analogy of Providence.
And this, for aught I see, might reasonably be said, even
though we should not take in the consideration of God's
moral government over the world. But, take in this consideration,
and consequently, that the character of virtue
and piety is a necessary qualification for the future state,
and then we may distinctly see how and in what respects
the present life may be a preparation for it.</p></div>

<p>Butler's style is uniform throughout, and if it have no
other merit, may be praised for honesty. It is wholly free
from the artifices of the rhetorician; if it is wanting in
charm, it is never weak; if it is sometimes obscure, it must
be remembered that the author does not write for readers
who find it a trouble to think. The bishop's obscurity was
not due to negligence. 'Confusion and perplexity in writing,'
he says, 'is indeed without excuse; because anyone
may, if he pleases, know whether he understands and sees<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
through what he is about; and it is unpardonable for a
man to lay his thoughts before others when he is conscious
that he himself does not know whereabouts he is, or how
the matter before him stands. It is coming abroad in disorder,
which he ought to be dissatisfied to find himself in at
home.'</p>

<p>Butler weighed his thoughts rather than his words in an
age when many distinguished writers were tempted to regard
form as of more consequence than substance. It must be
admitted, however, that if the ideal of fine literature be the
expression of beautiful and richly suggestive thoughts in a
style elevated by the imagination, and by a sense of rhythmical
harmony, Bishop Butler's place is not among men of
letters. His profound sense of the seriousness of life
limited his range; but as a thinker, what he lost in versatility
he probably gained in depth. The <i>Analogy</i> is a
striking instance of a great work wholly without imagination,
while full of the intellectual life which sustains the
student's attention. There is not a dull page in the book,
or one in which the author's meaning cannot be grasped by
thoughtful readers. The work is full of weighty sayings
on the power of conscience, the rule of right which a man
has within him, the force of habit, the necessity of action in
relation to belief, and the uselessness of passive impressions.
It has been said that the defect of the eighteenth century
theology 'was not in having too much good sense, but in
having nothing besides,' and the straining after good sense,
so prominent in Pope's age, affected alike, men of letters,
philosophers, and theologians. The virtue was carried to
excess and is conspicuous in Butler. He has his weaknesses
both as a philosopher and a theologian, but the
reader of the <i>Analogy</i> and of the three sermons on Human
Nature, will be conscious that he is in the presence of a
great mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">William Warburton
(1698-1779).</div>

<p>William Warburton, Pope's commentator, was born at
Newark-upon-Trent in 1698, and died
as Bishop of Gloucester in 1779. The
main argument of his principal work,
<i>The Divine Legation of Moses</i> (1738-41), is based upon the
astounding paradox that the legation of Moses must have
been divine because he never invoked the promises or
threatenings of a future state. The book is remarkable
for its arrogance and lack of 'sweet reasonableness.' It
claims no attention from the student of English literature,
neither would Warburton himself were it not for his association
with Pope. Allusion has been already made to
Crousaz's hostile criticism of the <i>Essay on Man</i> (1737)
on the ground that it led to fatalism, and was destructive
of the foundations of natural religion. Warburton, who
had previously denounced the 'rank atheism' of the poem,
now endeavoured to defend it, and how effectually he did
so in Pope's judgment is seen in his grateful acknowledgment
of the critic's labours. 'I know I meant just what
you explain,' he wrote, 'but I did not explain my own
meaning as well as you. You understand me as well as I
do myself, but you express me better than I could express
myself.'</p>

<p>Dr. Conyers Middleton's estimate of what Warburton
had done for Pope is more accurate: 'You have evinced
the orthodoxy of Mr. Pope's principles,' he says, 'but,
like the old commentators on his <i>Homer</i>, will be thought,
perhaps, in some places to have provided a meaning for
him that he himself never dreamt of.'<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The poet and Warburton met for the first time in 1740,
and the bookseller, Dodsley, who was present at the interview,
was astonished at the compliments which Pope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
lavished on his apologist. Henceforth, until the poet's
death, Warburton, who, according to Bishop Hurd, 'found
an image of himself in his new acquaintance,' became his
counsellor and supporter, and among other achievements
added, as Ricardus Aristarchus, to the confusion of the
<i>Dunciad</i>. Ultimately, as Pope's annotator, he produced
much laborious and comparatively worthless criticism, and
contrived by his immense fighting qualities as a critic and
polemic to make a considerable noise in the world. One
incident in the friendship of the poet and of the divine is
worth recording. In 1741 Pope and Warburton were at
Oxford together, and while there the Vice-Chancellor
offered to confer on the poet the degree of D.C.L., and on
Warburton that of D.D. Some hesitation, however, on
the part of the university having occurred with regard to
the latter, Pope wrote to his friend saying, 'As for mine I
will die before I receive one, in an art I am ignorant of, at
a place where there remains any scruple of bestowing one
on you, in a science of which you are so great a master.
In short I will be doctored with you, or not at all.'</p>

<p>Warburton's stupendous self-assertion concealed to some
extent his heavy style and poverty of thought. His aim
was to startle by paradoxes, since he could not convince
by argument. No one could call an opponent names in
the Billingsgate style more effectively, and every man who
ventured to differ from him was either a knave or a fool.
'Warburton's stock argument,' it has been said, 'is a
threat to cudgel anyone who disputes his opinion.' He
was a laborious student, and the mass of work he
accomplished exhibits his robust energy, but he has left
nothing which lives in literature or in theology. He was,
however, a man of various acquisitions, and won, for that
reason, the praise of Dr. Johnson. 'The table is always
full, sir. He brings things from the north and the south<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
and from every quarter. In his <i>Divine Legation</i> you
are always entertained. He carries you round and round
without carrying you forward to the point, but then you
have no wish to be carried forward.'</p>

<p>Bentley's more concise description of Warburton's attainments
deserves to be recorded. He was, he says, 'a man
of monstrous appetite, but bad digestion.'</p>

<p>Warburton's <i>Shakespeare</i> appeared in 1747, his <i>Pope</i> in
1751. It cannot be said that either poet has cause to be
grateful to his commentator. Of his <i>Shakespeare</i> a few
words may be appropriately said here. In this pretentious
and untrustworthy edition, Warburton accuses Theobald
of plagiarism, treats him with contempt, and then uses his
text to print from. In his Preface he declares that his
own Notes 'take in the whole compass of Criticism,' and
he professes to restore the poet's genuine Text. Yet, as
the editors of the <i>Cambridge Shakespeare</i> observe, there is
no trace, so far as they have discovered, 'of his having
collated for himself either the earlier Folios or any of the
Quartos.' Warburton professed to observe the severe
canons of literal criticism, and this suggested the title to
Thomas Edwards of a volume in which the critic's editorial
pretensions are attacked with some humour and much
justice.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>We may add that Bishop Hurd, Warburton's most intimate
friend, edited his works in seven volumes (1788),
and six years later, by way of preface to a new edition,
published an <i>Account of the Life, Writings, and Character
of the Author</i>.</p>

WRITERS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">John Armstrong</span> (1709-1779), a Scotchman by birth,
practised in London as a physician after some surgical
experience in the navy. Believing any subject suitable for
poetry, he wrote in blank verse, reminding one of Thomson,
<i>The Art of Preserving Health</i> (1744), a poem containing
some powerful passages, and many which are better fitted
for a medical treatise than for poetry. An earlier and licentious
poem <i>The Economy of Love</i>, which injured him in
his profession, was 'revised and corrected by the author'
in 1768.</p>

<p>If bulk were a sign of merit <span class="smcap">Sir Richard Blackmore</span>
(1650-1729) would not rank with the minor poets. He
wrote several long and wearisome epics, his best work in
Dr. Johnson's judgment being <i>The Creation</i> (1712), which
was praised by Addison in the <i>Spectator</i> as 'one of the
most useful and noble productions in our English verse,' a
judgment the modern reader is not likely to endorse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry Brooke</span> (1706-1783), an Irishman, was the
author of a poem entitled <i>Universal Beauty</i> (1735). Four
years later he published <i>Gustavus Vasa</i>, a tragedy, which
was not allowed to be acted, the sentiments being too
liberal for the government. His <i>Fool of Quality</i> (1766) a
novel in five volumes, delighted John Wesley, and in our
day, Charles Kingsley, who praises its 'broad and genial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
humanity.' Brooke was a follower of William Law, whose
mysticism is to be seen in the story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Broome</span> (1689-1745) is chiefly known from
his association with Pope in the translation of the <i>Odyssey</i>,
of which enough has been said elsewhere (p. <a href="#Page_38">38</a>). His
name suggested the following epigram to Henley:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Pope came off clean with Homer; but they say<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Broome</i> went before and kindly swept the way.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He entered holy orders, had two livings in Suffolk and one
in Norfolk, and married a wealthy widow. His verses are
mechanically correct, but are empty of poetry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Byrom</span> (1691-1763), the friend and disciple of
William Law, the author of the <i>Serious Call</i>, is best remembered
for his system of shorthand. In a characteristic,
copious, and not very attractive journal, he
describes, for the consolation of his fellow mortals, how
he makes resolutions and breaks them. Byrom wrote
rhyme with ease and on subjects with which poetry has
nothing to do. His most successful achievement was a
pastoral, <i>Colin and Ph&oelig;be</i>, which appeared in the <i>Spectator</i>
(Vol. viii., No. 603). It was written in honour of the
daughter of Dr. Bentley, Master of Trinity, 'not,' it has
been said, 'because he wished to win her affections, but
because he desired to secure her father's interest for the
Fellowship for which he was a candidate.' The plan was
successful. The one verse of Byrom's that every one has
read is the happy epigram:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'God bless the King!&mdash;I mean the faith's defender&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God bless (no harm in blessing!) the Pretender!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But who Pretender is, or who is King&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God bless us all!&mdash;that's quite another thing.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Samuel Clarke</span> (1675-1729), a man of large attainments
in science and divinity, was the favourite theo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>logian
of Queen Caroline, who admired his latitudinarian
views, and delighted in his conversation. His works, edited
by Bishop Hoadly, were published in 1738 in four folio
volumes. In 1704 he delivered the Boyle lectures on <i>The
Being and Attributes of God</i>, and in 1705 <i>On Natural and
Revealed Religion</i>. His <i>Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity</i>
(1712) was condemned by convocation. In defence of Sir
Isaac Newton, Clarke had a controversy with Leibnitz,
and having published the correspondence dedicated it to
the Queen. His sermons, Mr. Leslie Stephen says, are
'for the most part not sermons at all, but lectures upon
metaphysics.' In Addison's judgment Clarke was one of
the most accurate, learned, and judicious writers the age
had produced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elijah Fenton</span> (1683-1730) wrote poems and <i>Mariamne</i>
a tragedy, in which, according to his friend Broome, 'great
Sophocles revives and reappears.' It was acted with applause,
and brought nearly one thousand pounds to its
author. His name is now chiefly known as having assisted
Pope in his translation of the <i>Odyssey</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard Glover</span> (1712-1785), the son of a London
merchant, was himself a merchant of high reputation in the
city. He also 'cultivated the Muses,' and his <i>Leonidas</i>
(1737), an elaborate poem in blank verse, preferred by
some critics of the day to <i>Paradise Lost</i>, passed through
several editions and was praised by Fielding and by Lord
Chatham. Power is visible in this epic, which displays
also a large amount of knowledge, but the salt of genius is
wanting, and the poem, despite many estimable qualities,
is now forgotten. <i>Leonidas</i> was followed by <i>Boadicea</i>
(1758), and <i>The Atheniad</i>, published after his death in 1788.
Glover was a politician as well as a verseman. His party
feeling probably inspired <i>Admiral Hosier's Ghost</i> (1739),
a ballad still remembered and preserved in anthologies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matthew Green</span> (1696-1737) is the author of <i>The Spleen</i>,
an original and brightly written poem. <i>The Grotto</i>, printed
but not published in 1732, is also marked by freshness
of treatment. Green's poems, written in octosyllabic
metre, were published after his death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James Hammond</span> (1710-1742) produced many forlorn
elegies on a lady who appears to have scorned him, and
who lived in 'maiden meditation' for nearly forty years
after the poet's death. His love is said to have affected his
mind for a time. 'Sure Hammond has no right,' says
Shenstone, 'to the least inventive merit. I do not think
that there is a single thought in his elegies of any eminence
that is not literally translated.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nathaniel Hooke</span> (1690-1763), the author of a <i>Roman
History</i>, is better known as the editor of <i>An Account of the
conduct of the Dowager Duchess of Marlborough, from her
first coming to Court in the year 1710, in a letter from herself
to Lord &mdash;&mdash; in 1742</i>. The duchess is said to have dictated
this letter from her bed, and to have been so eager for its
completion that she insisted on Hooke's not leaving the
house till he had finished it. He was munificently rewarded
for his labour by a present of £5,000. It was Hooke, a
zealous Roman Catholic, who, when Pope was dying, asked
him if he should not send for a priest, and received the
poet's hearty thanks for putting him in mind of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Hughes</span> (1677-1719) was the author of poems, an
opera, a masque, several translations, and a tragedy, <i>The
Siege of Damascus</i>, which was well received, and kept its
place on the stage for some years. He died on the first
night's performance of the play. Several articles in the
<i>Tatler</i> and <i>Spectator</i> are from his pen. In 1715 he published
an edition of Spenser in six volumes. Hughes
received warm praise from Steele, and enjoyed also the
friendship of Addison.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conyers Middleton</span> (1683-1750) is now chiefly known
for an extravagantly eulogistic life of <i>Cicero</i> (1741), in
which, as Macaulay observes, he 'resorted to the most disingenuous
shifts, to unpardonable distortions and suppressions
of facts.' The book is written in a forcible and lively
style. A man of considerable learning, Middleton was a
violent controversialist, who liked better to attack and to
defend than to dwell in the serene atmosphere of literature
or of practical divinity. He assailed the famous
Richard Bentley with such rancour that he had to apologize
and was fined £50 by the Court of King's Bench.
Middleton was a doctor of divinity, but his controversial
works, while never directly attacking the chief tenets of the
religion he professed, lean far more to the side of the Deists
than to the orthodox creed, and, indeed, it would not be
uncharitable to class him among them. He appears, like
Swift, to have chiefly regarded the Christian religion as an
institution of service to the stability of the State. Of the
<i>Miscellaneous Works</i> which were published after his death
in five volumes, the most elaborate and the most provocative
of disputation is <i>A Free Inquiry into the Miraculous Powers
which are supposed to have subsisted in the Christian Church
through several successive centuries</i> (1749). Middleton was
educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and in 1734 was
elected librarian of the University.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard Savage</span> (1698-1743), whose fate is one of the
most melancholy in the annals of versemen, lives in the
admirable though neither impartial nor wholly accurate
biography of Dr. Johnson. In 1719 he produced <i>Love in a
Veil</i>, a comedy from the Spanish; and in 1723 his tragedy
<i>Sir Thomas Overbury</i> was acted, but with little success.
In the same year he published <i>The Bastard</i>, a poem which
is said to have driven his mother out of society. <i>The
Wanderer</i>, in five cantos, appeared in 1729, and was regarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
by the author as his masterpiece. It has some vigorous
lines and several descriptive passages that are not conventional.
Savage died in prison at Bristol, a city which
recalls the equally painful story of Chatterton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lewis Theobald</span> (1688-1744), the original hero of the
<i>Dunciad</i>, was a dramatist and translator, but is chiefly
known as the author of <i>Shakespeare Restored; or specimens
of blunders committed or unamended in Pope's edition of the
poet</i> (1726). This was followed two years later by <i>Proposals
for Publishing Emendations and Remarks on Shakespeare</i>,
and in 1733 by his edition of the dramatist in seven
volumes. 'Theobald as an editor,' say the editors of the
<i>Cambridge Shakespeare</i>, 'is incomparably superior to his
predecessors and to his immediate successor Warburton,
although the latter had the advantage of working on his
materials. He was the first to recall a multitude of readings
of the first Folio unquestionably right, but unnoticed
by previous editors. Many most brilliant emendations
... are due to him.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Walsh</span> (1663-1708) has chronologically little
claim to be noticed here, for his poems were published before
the beginning of the century, but he is to be remembered
as the early friend and wise counsellor of Pope, and also
as the author, I believe, of the only English sonnet between
Milton's in 1658, and Gray's, on Richard West, in
1742.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne Finch</span>, Countess of Winchelsea (1660-1720), published
a volume of verse in 1713 under the title of <i>Miscellany
Poems on Several Occasions, Written by a Lady</i>.
The book contains a <i>Nocturnal Reverie</i>, which has some
lines showing a close and faithful observation of rural
sounds and sights, as for example:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'When the loosed horse, now as his pasture leads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes slowly grazing through the adjoining meads,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose stealing pace and lengthened shade we fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till torn-up forage in his teeth we hear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When nibbling sheep at large pursue their food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And unmolested kine rechew the cud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When curlews cry beneath the village walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to her straggling brood the partridge calls.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The <i>Nocturnal Reverie</i>, however, is an exception to the
general character of Lady Winchelsea's poems, which consist
chiefly of odes (including the inevitable Pindaric),
fables, songs, affectionate addresses to her husband,
poetical epistles, and a tragedy, <i>Aristomenes; or the Royal
Shepherd</i>. The <i>Petition for an Absolute Retreat</i> is one of
the best pieces in the volume. It displays great facility in
versification, and a love of country delights.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Yalden</span> (1670-1736), born in Exeter, and
educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, entered into holy
orders (1711), and was appointed lecturer of moral philosophy.
'Of his poems,' writes Dr. Johnson, 'many are of
that irregular kind which, when he formed his poetical
character, was supposed to be Pindaric.' Pindarics were
indeed the bane of the age. Every minor poet, no matter
however feeble his poetical wings might be, endeavoured
to fly with Pindar. Like Gay, Yalden tried his skill as a
writer of fables.</p>

<div class="blockquot gap3"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note.</span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Veal's Ghost</i> (see pp. 186-187). A curious discovery,
made by Mr. G. A. Aitken (see <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, January,
1895), makes it certain, he thinks, that 'the whole narrative is
literally true.' He even hopes that the receipt for scouring Mrs.
Veal's gown may some day be found. Mr. Aitken seems to infer
that Defoe's other tales will also turn out to be true histories, but
Defoe avers, with all the seriousness he expends on Mrs. Veal,
that he witnessed the great Plague of London, which it is needless
to say he did not.</p></div>

<h3>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS</h3>


<h4>THE AGE OF CHAUCER</h4>

<p>"This little monograph may lay fair claim to be regarded as complete, acute,
stimulating, and scholarly."&mdash;<i>School World.</i></p>

<p>"The book is thoroughly up-to-date, an important consideration in dealing
with Middle English literature, and does not lose itself in too minute a consideration
of those works which are only of philological and not of literary
value. The accounts of the W. Midland alliterative poetry, of the development
of prose, and the work of the poet Gower, are specially good. The treatment
of Chaucer is thorough and scholarly."&mdash;<i>University Correspondent.</i></p>

<p>"An admirable handbook, dealing in a lucid style and in a highly critical
spirit with one of the most important periods in the history of English literature."&mdash;<i>Westminster
Review.</i></p>


<h4>THE AGE OF DRYDEN</h4>

<p>"This scholarly little volume from the learned pen of Dr. Garnett....
Within the limits of his space Dr. Garnett surveys the several departments
of literature in this period with singular comprehensiveness, broad sympathy,
and fine critical sagacity."&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>"The series which Professor Hales is editing aims at being that very difficult
and important something between the text-book for schools and the
gracefully allusive literary essay. Dr. Garnett has done his part of the work
admirably. Most readable is his book, written with a fine sense of proportion,
and containing many independent judgements, yet even, so far as minor
names and dates and facts are concerned, complete enough for all save a
searcher after minutiae."&mdash;<i>Bookman.</i></p>

<p>"Though planned on the scale of the manual, this book is actually the first
attempt worth naming to grasp in one separate review the literature of the last
forty years of the seventeenth century, a time which, as Dr. Garnett well says,
'with all its defects, had a faculty for producing masterpieces.' Dr. Garnett's
name is a warrant for his acquaintance not only with the masterpieces but with
much besides, and with more than all that need be named in the kind of survey
he undertakes."&mdash;<i>Manchester Guardian.</i></p>


<h4>THE AGE OF POPE</h4>

<p>"A 'handbook' is scarcely a fair description of so readable and companionable
a volume, which aims not only at giving accurate information, but at
directing the reader's steps 'through a country exhaustless in variety and
interest.'"&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>"The biographical portion of Mr. Dennis's book is really admirable. The
accuracy of the details and the knowledge exhibited by the author of the
social and political life of the period show how thoroughly he has mastered
his subject."&mdash;<i>Westminster Review.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Dennis writes freely and simply, and with a thorough knowledge of
the period with which he deals, and goes straight to the point without revelling
in circumambient fancies. The result of this is that in 250 pages of good print
we have as concise a history of Queen Anne literature as we could wish."&mdash;<i>Cambridge
Review.</i></p>

<p>"An excellent little volume."&mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></p>


<h4>THE AGE OF SHAKESPEARE</h4>

<p>"Both volumes are excellently done, with knowledge, judgement, and a
pleasant touch of vivacity. It is no easy matter to make a text-book both informing
and readable; but here the feat is accomplished. I have read 'The
Age of Shakespeare' with unflagging interest and pleasure.... Everywhere
one has the restful sensation of dealing with men of competent scholarship and
sound critical instinct. Especially valuable, to my thinking, is the chronological
table of the chief publications of each year from 1579 to 1630."&mdash;Mr. William
Archer in the <i>Morning Leader</i>.</p>

<p>"These two volumes are, in short, a notable accession to the useful series to
which they belong, and they constitute a luminous aid to the interpretation
alike of the scope and quality of the literary activity which has rendered the
'Age of Shakespeare' classic in the annals of English literature."&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p>

<p>"The book is a well-informed and well-connected and intelligent exposition
of its subject. It is more than a mere handbook. It is a <i>history</i>, though on a
small scale."&mdash;<i>Journal of Education.</i></p>


<h4>THE AGE OF MILTON</h4>

<p>"A very readable and serviceable manual of English literature during the
central years of the seventeenth century."&mdash;<i>Glasgow Herald.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Masterman has written a book which combines the preciseness of a
text-book with the fullness of thought of a monograph. Indeed, this compact
little work will be studied with as much earnestness by the student as it will be
read with pleasure by the lover of <i>belles lettres</i>.... We lay down the book
delighted with what we have read."&mdash;<i>Birmingham Daily Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"A work which reflects the utmost credit on its author ... luminous and
at the same time impartial."&mdash;<i>Westminster Review.</i></p>

<p>"This excellent epitome ... very happily indicates the golden afterglow
of the Elizabethan sun."&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle.</i></p>


<h4>THE AGE OF JOHNSON</h4>

<p>"The uniform excellence of Mr. Seccombe's manual of English literary
history from 1748 to 1798 affords scarcely any opening for detailed criticism.
Little can be said, except that everything is just as it ought to be: the arrangement
perfect, the length of the notices justly proportioned, the literary
judgements sound and illuminating; while the main purpose of conveying information
is kept so steadily in view that, while the book is worthy of a place
in the library, the student could desire no better guide for an examination."&mdash;<i>Bookman.</i></p>

<p>"He has knowledge, he is eminently careful, and, best of all in a handbook-maker
of this kind, he is judicial. We like Mr. Seccombe's arrangement.
There is a capital introduction, solid and grave rather than brilliant, on which
the student may stand in confidence before he dives off into the stream of his
tutor's survey. Briefly, we have here a thorough, almost encyclopaedic, review
of a great literary period&mdash;stimulating to the younger student, and to his elder
refreshing by its perception."&mdash;<i>Outlook.</i></p>

<p>"This book is one of the best of its kind, and we heartily recommend it to
our readers."&mdash;<i>Journal of Education.</i></p>

<p>"The young student could not read a better book to get a comprehensive
and yet detailed account of the literary history of the latter half of the
eighteenth century."&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>


<h4>THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH</h4>

<p>"It is an admirable little work all the way through and one which the ripest
students of the period may read with interest and profit."&mdash;<i>Guardian.</i></p>

<p>"The desiderated text-book of the period 1798 to 1830 <span class="small">A.D.</span> is no longer to
seek. More than that, it has been written by the one Englishman most competent
to deal with it. Whatever Professor Herford does he does well; but he
has given us nothing at once so good and so helpful as this book."&mdash;<i>University
Correspondent.</i></p>

<p>"The introductory essay on Romanticism in our literature is an admirable
piece of work, full of suggestive thought, but Professor Herford is at his best&mdash;and
a very fine best it is&mdash;in his brief summaries of the lives and works of
individual writers. His Cobbett, his Lamb, and others that might be instanced,
are veritable gems of biographical and critical compression presented
with true literary finish."&mdash;<i>Literary World.</i></p>

<p>"A book which is remarkable for freshness and distinction of style, philosophic
grasp of first principles, and critical insight.... When we add that
the book is also conspicuous for delicacy of literary appreciation and ripe
judgement, both of men and movements, we have said enough to show that
we consider its claims are unusual."&mdash;<i>Speaker.</i></p>


<h4>THE AGE OF TENNYSON</h4>

<p>"A capital little handbook of modern English literature."&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>"An instructive and readable manual ... an admirable first text-book on
the subject."&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>"Professor Walker has done his allotted task with singular skill, wonderful
judiciousness, critical insight, adequate knowledge and mastery of facts, keen
discernment of qualities and effectiveness of grouping.... We have read no
review of the whole of the Tennysonian age so genuinely fresh in matter,
method, style, critical canons, and selectedness of phrase. As a small book
on a great subject, it is a special treasure."&mdash;<i>Educational News.</i></p>

<h3>HENRY S. PANCOAST</h3>

<p>"Seems to me to fulfil better, on the whole, than any other 'Introduction'
known to me, the real requirements of such a book as distinguished from a
'Sketch' or a 'Summary.' It rightly does not attempt to be cyclopaedic, but
isolates a number of figures of first-rate importance, and deals with these in a
very attractive way. The directions for reading are also excellent."&mdash;Professor
